1
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:34,939
<i>The year was 1891.</i>

2
00:00:35,106 --> 00:00:37,525
<i>Storm clouds were brewing over Europe.</i>

3
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,405
<i>France and Germany
were at each other's throats...</i>

4
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:45,533
<i>the result of a series of bombings.</i>

5
00:00:47,202 --> 00:00:49,704
<i>Some said it was Nationalists...</i>

6
00:00:50,205 --> 00:00:52,373
<i>others, the anarchists.</i>

7
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,542
<i>But as usual...</i>

8
00:00:55,043 --> 00:00:58,421
<i>my friend Sherlock Holmes</i>

9
00:00:58,588 --> 00:01:00,673
<i>had a different theory entirely.</i>

10
00:01:07,597 --> 00:01:10,600
<i>Bombing in Strasbourg!
Read all about it!</i>

11
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:13,436
- Thank you.
- Anarchists suspected...

12
00:01:13,603 --> 00:01:16,064
in Strasbourg bombing!

13
00:01:25,823 --> 00:01:28,409
Bombing in Strasbourg!

14
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:05,280
When did you start working
for the postal service?

15
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:08,449
That was you back there.

16
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:11,244
Shame your activities
have landed you in the gutter.

17
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:14,539
A curious parcel.
Who's the intended recipient?

18
00:02:14,706 --> 00:02:16,791
Why don't we discuss that
over dinner tonight?

19
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,002
- I'm free for lunch.
- Hmm. I'm not.

20
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:21,671
How about the Savoy, 8:00?

21
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:22,880
- Splendid.
- Hmm.

22
00:02:23,047 --> 00:02:24,799
And will you be coming as yourself?

23
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:27,176
Most likely.

24
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:30,638
Three men have been following you
for the last half mile...

25
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:32,765
their motives highly unsavory.

26
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,061
No.

27
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:48,990
Oh, and, by the way, they're not pursuing me,
they're escorting me.

28
00:02:49,157 --> 00:02:53,119
And instead of three,
there seems to be, uh, four.

29
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:57,623
Steady hands with that, Irene.

30
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,835
Oh, I don't think it's my hands
you have to worry about.

31
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:04,005
Be careful with the face, boys.
We do have a dinner date tonight.

32
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:05,548
Don't fill up on bread.

33
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:32,367
I forgot the rest.

34
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:37,747
Oh, it's coming back now.

35
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:08,903
Peelers!

36
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:20,975
We now come to Lot 34...

37
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:25,980
Egyptian sarcophagus
of outstanding provenance...

38
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:28,149
retrieved from the Valley of the Kings.

39
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:30,526
Your payment, doctor.
He sends his thanks.

40
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:31,819
Who will bid...

41
00:05:32,153 --> 00:05:33,279
100 pounds?

42
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,573
One hundred. Thank you, sir.

43
00:05:37,408 --> 00:05:40,161
Please, give this to him.
He's expecting it.

44
00:05:40,703 --> 00:05:44,123
Tell him our friend thinks
I delivered it to his sister.

45
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,672
Uh-- Stay...

46
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,674
while I check the contents.

47
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:57,303
I was assured full payment
would be there.

48
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,264
Yes, but assured by whom?

49
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,183
Have you ever met him in person?

50
00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:05,728
Or like me, have you been--?

51
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:08,814
Hold it, hold it.
Please, don't move it.

52
00:06:09,357 --> 00:06:12,652
Judging from size and weight,
it's not the payment you were expecting.

53
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:15,780
I'd wager the contents
are rather more incendiary.

54
00:06:15,947 --> 00:06:18,282
- Who is this?
- It's--

55
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:19,492
Hello, darling.

56
00:06:24,997 --> 00:06:29,043
Oh, dear. I told you not to move it.
It seems a secondary charge has been activated.

57
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,255
Sweet thing, I might need your help
in the disposal of this parcel.

58
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:37,176
One thousand six hundred, 1700, 1800.

59
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:39,303
- Well, good luck.
- One million pounds.

60
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:44,517
Oh, and by the way, fire.

61
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:45,893
Fire!

62
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:53,484
Leave my side,
you'll be dead in an hour.

63
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:55,194
And don't be late for dinner.

64
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:58,489
My schedule will be quite tight
because of these activities here.

65
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:02,410
- I've never been late in my life, only early.
- Fashionably.

66
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:07,331
Very witty.
So confident, even in retreat.

67
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:10,626
I'll hold onto that.
We'll read it together over an aperitif.

68
00:07:10,793 --> 00:07:14,297
Fine. Dinner and a show.

69
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:21,095
Stay. Trust me.
This is what I do for a living.

70
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:25,766
Herr Hoffmanstahl,
you should count yourself lucky.

71
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:30,605
This faceless man with whom you find yourself
in business is no ordinary criminal.

72
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:35,401
He's the Napoleon of crime.
Fortunately, you now have me as an ally.

73
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:38,821
I'm a consulting detective of some repute.

74
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:41,699
Perhaps you've heard of me?
My name is Sherlock--

75
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:45,620
Holmes.

76
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:33,292
A fresh pot of tea.
Thank you, George.

77
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,252
Yes, Miss Adler.

78
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:39,715
Fine choice, this place.

79
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:42,927
Do you have the letter?

80
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:45,096
It was taken.

81
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,100
Taken? Now, that is unfortunate.

82
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,189
During the chaos created
by your package.

83
00:08:55,356 --> 00:08:56,357
Thank you.

84
00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:03,030
Perhaps if you had shared your plans.

85
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:06,450
You wish to know my plans now, do you?

86
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:10,079
Did you imagine, Miss Adler,
that something would happen to you?

87
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:13,124
Is that why you chose to meet here
in a public place?

88
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,542
Your favorite restaurant?

89
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:48,951
I don't blame you.

90
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:52,621
I blame myself.

91
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:58,544
It's been apparent to me for some time that
you had succumbed to your feelings for him.

92
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:05,384
And this isn't the first occasion Mr. Holmes
has inconvenienced me in recent months.

93
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:08,095
The question is...

94
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:11,724
what to do about it.

95
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:21,525
But that's my problem to solve now.

96
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:27,782
I no longer require your services.

97
00:11:57,705 --> 00:11:59,456
Mrs. Hudson?

98
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,377
Oh, Mrs. Hudson?

99
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,090
Holmes, you in there?

100
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,100
Your hedge needs trimming.

101
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:23,188
Where am I?

102
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:26,233
I don't care where you are
as long as you're ready.

103
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:32,281
I'm waiting.

104
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:37,661
I'm not gonna play this game.

105
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:42,082
Remember, I have to catch the last--

106
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:47,130
train.

107
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:51,300
- That's you dead, I'm afraid.
- You win.

108
00:12:53,302 --> 00:12:57,181
I lose. Game over.

109
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:01,060
Still don't see me?

110
00:13:10,778 --> 00:13:12,947
I'm not going out with you
dressed like that.

111
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:17,326
Would you prefer I joined you
in the fashion faux pas...

112
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:20,704
of wearing fine military dress
with that heinous handmade scarf...

113
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:23,248
clearly one of your fiancée's
early efforts?

114
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,584
Oh, how I've missed you, Holmes.

115
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:28,337
Have you? Why?

116
00:13:28,963 --> 00:13:32,383
I've barely noticed your absence.
Then again, I'm knee-deep in research.

117
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:35,386
Extracting fluids from the
adrenal glands of sheep...

118
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:38,263
and designing my own urban camouflage...

119
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,975
all the while verging
on a decisive breakthrough...

120
00:13:41,141 --> 00:13:45,479
in the single most important case
of my career, perhaps of all time.

121
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:48,857
Mrs. Hudson, how are you?

122
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:52,987
Oh. I'm so pleased to see you, doctor.
Thank you for inviting me tomorrow.

123
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:55,781
And thank you for looking after Gladstone.

124
00:13:55,948 --> 00:14:01,912
Dear, dear sickly-sweet Nanny,
might I have a word?

125
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:06,625
Yummy. Feed the snake, woman.

126
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,877
You feed it.

127
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:12,506
Touchy, touchy.

128
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,176
Doctor, you must get him to a sanatorium.

129
00:14:16,427 --> 00:14:19,471
He's been on a diet of coffee, tobacco,
and coca leaves.

130
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,767
He never sleeps. I hear multiple voices
as if he's rehearsing a play.

131
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:29,773
- Leave him to me.
- Don't you have a goat that needs worming?

132
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,401
Oh, how kind of you to remind me.

133
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:36,572
So much to look forward to.
What would I do without you?

134
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:39,742
Good luck with your patient, doctor.

135
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:42,036
Why are you here?

136
00:14:43,245 --> 00:14:45,247
I'm getting married tomorrow.

137
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:48,500
Oh! Embrace me.

138
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,587
Watson's getting married.

139
00:14:51,754 --> 00:14:55,132
- You've lost a few pounds, Holmes.
- Yes, and you've picked them up.

140
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:57,343
Noshing on Mary's muffins, no doubt.

141
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,388
Pour us a brandy.
The stag party has begun.

142
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:05,726
It is our last adventure, Watson.

143
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:07,936
I intend to make the most of it.

144
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:21,825
I see you've made good use
of my old office.

145
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:24,745
- Do you like my spider's web?
- Is that what you call it?

146
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:26,663
Follow that strand.

147
00:15:28,082 --> 00:15:32,419
Question: What do a scandal involving
an Indian cotton tycoon...

148
00:15:32,586 --> 00:15:34,671
the overdose of a Chinese opium trader...

149
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:36,840
bombings in Strasbourg and Vienna...

150
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:40,469
and the death of a steel magnate in America
all have in common?

151
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:48,102
Well, according to your diorama,
Professor James Moriarty.

152
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:49,269
Indeed.

153
00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:54,525
Mathematical genius.
Celebrated author and lecturer.

154
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:56,276
Boxing champion at Cambridge...

155
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:59,404
where he made friends
with our current prime minister.

156
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:02,282
Do you have any evidence
to substantiate your claim?

157
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:08,372
This. Now do you see?

158
00:16:10,457 --> 00:16:12,751
- Dr. Hoffmanstahl's death?
- Yes.

159
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,254
I've heard you speak of him,
extolling his virtues.

160
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,216
Hoffmanstahl was at the forefront
of medical innovations, a true pioneer.

161
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:22,886
Just the other day, I averted an explosion
that was intended for him.

162
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:26,181
Says here he died of a heart attack.

163
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,769
Has all my instruction been for naught?
You still read the official statement and believe it.

164
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:33,313
It's a game, dear man, a shadowy game.

165
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,359
We're playing oat and mouse,
the professor and I. Cloak and dagger.

166
00:16:37,985 --> 00:16:39,528
I thought it was spider and fly?

167
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:42,739
I'm not a fly, I'm a cat.

168
00:16:42,906 --> 00:16:45,158
Not a mouse, but a dagger.

169
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:46,827
You're drinking embalming fluid.

170
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:50,664
Oh. Yes. Care for a drop?

171
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:52,124
You do seem--

172
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,333
- Excited?
- Manic.

173
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,501
- I am.
- Verging on--

174
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:56,128
- Ecstatic?
- Psychotic.

175
00:16:57,921 --> 00:17:01,049
- Should've brought a sedative.
- I'll give my life to see his demise.

176
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:05,512
He must be stopped before
his evil machinations come to a crescendo.

177
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,972
And how will he do all this?

178
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:10,934
Don't be a dingy bird.
Bad people do bad things because they can.

179
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:15,188
No one, not the victims, the police,
the governments, not anyone--

180
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:17,983
- Except the great Sherlock Holmes...
- Correct.

181
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,485
- on this diet, will work it all out.
- Right.

182
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:23,405
- Or thereabouts.
- Thereabouts, not quite there.

183
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:25,699
Here's to your good health.

184
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:28,660
Dingy bird.

185
00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:35,250
What have you done to Gladstone now?

186
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:39,296
<i>Ricinus communis.</i>
The fruit is highly toxic.

187
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:40,881
He's barely breathing.

188
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:43,967
What an excellent opportunity.

189
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:45,302
This may be just the thing.

190
00:17:46,678 --> 00:17:49,932
Sorry, do you mind terribly
if I try my adrenal extract?

191
00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:52,559
How many times are you going
to kill my dog, Holmes?

192
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:57,481
Took off like a monkey from a box.

193
00:17:57,648 --> 00:18:00,275
- Hmm.
- I may need one of those in a few hours.

194
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:02,027
Consider it a wedding gift.

195
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:06,531
Watson, might we use an alternative exit?

196
00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:10,035
Is there something different about you?

197
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:12,245
I'm under observation.

198
00:18:12,996 --> 00:18:14,289
As you should be.

199
00:18:14,456 --> 00:18:15,832
You drive.

200
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:22,839
Will your beard be with us all night?

201
00:18:23,006 --> 00:18:26,510
I'll remove it once
we're south of Trafalgar Square.

202
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:30,263
If you believe Moriarty
has you under observation...

203
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,140
isn't this a bit conspicuous?

204
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:35,602
It's so overt, it's covert.

205
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:42,609
Trafalgar Square.
You must be safe by now.

206
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:52,869
Why are you looking at me
with such concern?

207
00:18:53,036 --> 00:18:57,666
I'm so very worried.
Your vitality's been drained from you.

208
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,586
- Marriage is the end, I tell you.
- I think of it as the beginning.

209
00:19:01,753 --> 00:19:03,046
- Armageddon.
- Rebirth.

210
00:19:03,213 --> 00:19:04,715
- Restriction.
- Structure.

211
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:07,551
- Answering to a woman.
- Being in a relationship.

212
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:12,055
A life in matrimony,
the possibility of a family.

213
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:13,849
Who wants to die alone?

214
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:17,060
We'll have a good old-fashioned romp tonight...

215
00:19:17,227 --> 00:19:20,731
you'll settle down, have a family,
and I'll die alone.

216
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:23,233
Yes, that's about it.

217
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:30,782
Perhaps it's better for one to die alone
than to live life in eternal purgatory.

218
00:19:33,994 --> 00:19:35,662
Anyway...

219
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,002
Not bad, that.

220
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:44,004
So where are we going?

221
00:19:44,171 --> 00:19:47,758
In the future, there'll be one of those machines
in every town in Europe.

222
00:19:47,924 --> 00:19:50,469
Loitering in the woodshed again,
are we, Myccie?

223
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:52,846
- Good evening, Sherly.
- Well.

224
00:19:53,013 --> 00:19:55,682
I see your bootmaker is ill, dear brother.

225
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:59,978
As I detect that you've recently changed
the brand of soap with which you shave.

226
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:02,355
The chimney in the front room
at Baker Street...

227
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:04,357
still needs a damn good sweeping up.

228
00:20:04,524 --> 00:20:08,361
Were you aware that the hackney carriage
by which you arrived had a damaged wheel?

229
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:11,281
Yes, the left. And it's plain
to the meanest intelligence...

230
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:14,868
that you have recently acquired
a new bow for your violin.

231
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:16,745
Same bow, new strings.

232
00:20:16,912 --> 00:20:20,290
And may I deduce, Mycroft--?
Good evening, by the way.

233
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:21,708
No.

234
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:24,753
- He doesn't.
- May I deduce that you...

235
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,092
who rarely strays from the path
that runs from your home to the Diogenes Club...

236
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:33,845
and never on a Monday when they serve
your favorite potted shrimps...

237
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:38,975
must be here for some
far more important reason than my stag party?

238
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:45,065
You know, he's nothing like as slow-witted
as you'd been leading me to believe, Sherly.

239
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:46,942
No, you're quite right, Dr. Watson...

240
00:20:47,109 --> 00:20:52,280
but with all the conflict in Europe
at the moment, the whole situation could--

241
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:54,616
Excuse me... suddenly erupt.

242
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:58,703
I am here to avoid a dire catastrophe.

243
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,541
If the concerns of two nations...

244
00:21:02,707 --> 00:21:04,668
which shall remain nameless...

245
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:09,214
but I can tell you they speak
French and German...

246
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:12,884
are not dealt with tonight,
I shall be forced to go to Switzerland...

247
00:21:13,051 --> 00:21:16,429
to attend the ghastly peace summit
in Reichenbach.

248
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:18,932
The worst thing about Switzerland
is the altitude.

249
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:21,351
It gives me nosebleeds,
exacerbates my asthma--

250
00:21:21,518 --> 00:21:24,813
I'm so glad you invited your brother.

251
00:21:40,328 --> 00:21:41,371
This looks promising.

252
00:21:41,746 --> 00:21:43,832
And your poison of choice, gentlemen?

253
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:46,668
We'll start with the champagne.
We may need several more chairs.

254
00:21:46,835 --> 00:21:48,837
Perhaps a good cigar.

255
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:52,632
And don't bother with the chairs.

256
00:21:53,717 --> 00:21:55,468
What is it your brother does exactly?

257
00:21:55,635 --> 00:21:58,430
He's the keeper
of the broom cupboard of state.

258
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:00,307
No ambition, no energy...

259
00:22:00,473 --> 00:22:04,269
yet I'm repeatedly told that he's
indispensable to the British government...

260
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:06,062
particularly the Foreign Office.

261
00:22:06,229 --> 00:22:08,940
- I would like to propose a toast.
- Really?

262
00:22:09,107 --> 00:22:11,985
To my dear friend, Dr. John--

263
00:22:12,986 --> 00:22:16,698
um, Hamish Watson...

264
00:22:16,865 --> 00:22:17,908
I'm right here.

265
00:22:18,074 --> 00:22:21,661
on the eve of his wedding. He--

266
00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:25,207
has been the best companion.

267
00:22:25,373 --> 00:22:28,084
Shouldn't we be waiting
for the boys from my rugby club?

268
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:30,670
He has always kept us--
They couldn't attend.

269
00:22:30,837 --> 00:22:32,797
flat-footed on the ground.

270
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:35,050
All of them? Hmm.
The chaps from my medical school?

271
00:22:35,217 --> 00:22:37,302
- They declined.
- The lads from the regiment?

272
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:41,181
- No man's better worth having at your side--
- Who is it you're looking for?

273
00:22:41,348 --> 00:22:43,934
Because I don't know
a single damn person here, do I?

274
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,645
There's no need for hysterics.
You know me and Mycroft.

275
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:49,981
- Don't be a ponce, Watson.
- Ponce?

276
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:54,319
You completely forgot about my stag party,
didn't you?

277
00:22:56,488 --> 00:22:59,157
- Why are we here?
- Your very good health, doctor.

278
00:22:59,324 --> 00:23:01,451
Shame none of your friends
could make it.

279
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:11,962
I'm going to the gaming tables.
I refuse for this night to be a total loss.

280
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,298
- Give me my money.
- Happily. Give me the wedding ring.

281
00:23:15,465 --> 00:23:18,468
So now you're interested
in being the best man.

282
00:23:18,635 --> 00:23:21,054
You're supposed to keep the ring anyway.

283
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:23,848
Just as you're supposed
to organize my stag party.

284
00:23:24,015 --> 00:23:26,685
- Don't want to lose it on a bet.
- And invite my friends...

285
00:23:26,851 --> 00:23:30,522
of which, by the way, there are many.
You're the one with no friends...

286
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:33,024
Sherly No Mates.

287
00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:39,823
He's all "me, me, me," isn't he?

288
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,543
I win!

289
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:04,306
Please, sit.

290
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:07,225
Put your money on the table
and we will begin.

291
00:24:13,023 --> 00:24:15,859
Welcome. I am Madam Simza.

292
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:23,992
Cards can illuminate your past...

293
00:24:24,451 --> 00:24:27,579
clarify your present,
and show you the future.

294
00:24:29,956 --> 00:24:33,626
If you have a specific question,
hold it in your mind.

295
00:24:41,843 --> 00:24:44,220
I'm holding.

296
00:24:45,513 --> 00:24:47,140
Let me know when you're ready.

297
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:49,809
Actually, I'd prefer to read...

298
00:24:50,352 --> 00:24:51,394
your fortune.

299
00:24:56,024 --> 00:24:58,360
Temperance inverted.

300
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:00,737
Indicative of volatility.

301
00:25:01,738 --> 00:25:04,824
A woman who has recently
taken her comfort in drink.

302
00:25:04,991 --> 00:25:08,370
From what does she seek solace?
What does she not wish to see?

303
00:25:09,996 --> 00:25:12,457
- A fool embarrassing himself?
- Hmm.

304
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:16,002
- Hmm.
- Oh, yes. The Fool.

305
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:20,006
Someone has been led astray,
involved in something without their knowledge.

306
00:25:20,173 --> 00:25:23,885
Not bad, but you have
to make me believe you.

307
00:25:24,052 --> 00:25:25,470
I have to see it in your eyes.

308
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:28,348
- Right. I can do better.
- Uh-huh.

309
00:25:28,932 --> 00:25:31,518
The Two of Cups, a powerful bond.

310
00:25:31,684 --> 00:25:34,771
But between whom?
A brother and sister perhaps?

311
00:25:36,314 --> 00:25:39,150
And I see a name. Yes, it's...

312
00:25:39,442 --> 00:25:41,152
Rene.

313
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:44,322
What do you want?

314
00:25:44,864 --> 00:25:45,865
The Devil.

315
00:25:51,204 --> 00:25:52,580
Why are we playing this game?

316
00:26:02,465 --> 00:26:03,550
Where did you get this?

317
00:26:03,716 --> 00:26:07,971
I stole it from a woman in an auction room,
but I believe it was intended for you.

318
00:26:23,945 --> 00:26:25,321
"Found my purpose in life."

319
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:29,784
So the question I've been holding is,
what purpose is Rene fulfilling?

320
00:26:33,746 --> 00:26:35,290
Time is up.

321
00:26:35,915 --> 00:26:38,084
I have other clients.

322
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:46,468
Though you may not have detected
the wisp of astrakhan fur...

323
00:26:46,634 --> 00:26:48,720
snagged on a nail
over my left shoulder...

324
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:51,764
you couldn't have failed to notice
the overpowering aroma...

325
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:53,892
of herring pickled in vodka...

326
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:56,936
in tandem with a truly unfortunate body odor.

327
00:26:57,103 --> 00:27:00,315
There's a man concealed
in the rafters above us.

328
00:27:00,482 --> 00:27:04,110
A Cossack, renowned for
their infeasible acrobatic abilities...

329
00:27:04,277 --> 00:27:07,739
and are notorious for moonlighting
as assassins.

330
00:27:07,906 --> 00:27:12,118
So it's safe to presume
that your next client is here to kill you.

331
00:27:12,285 --> 00:27:14,913
Anything else? No?

332
00:27:21,461 --> 00:27:24,172
<i>First, pillage the nest.</i>

333
00:27:27,258 --> 00:27:28,635
<i>Clip wings.</i>

334
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:33,306
<i>Now blunt his beak.</i>

335
00:27:37,977 --> 00:27:39,604
<i>Crack eggs.</i>

336
00:27:41,189 --> 00:27:44,025
<i>Scramble. Pinch of salt.</i>

337
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:48,071
<i>Touch of pepper.</i>

338
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,036
<i>Flip the omelet.</i>

339
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:01,793
<i>Additional seasoning required.</i>

340
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:06,297
<i>Breakfast is served.</i>

341
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:23,565
Come with me.
I need you alive. Now.

342
00:28:26,317 --> 00:28:27,652
Oh!

343
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:36,888
Didn't see that in the cards, did you?

344
00:29:40,516 --> 00:29:42,101
Oh...

345
00:29:57,033 --> 00:29:58,785
Coming down, folks, coming down.

346
00:29:58,951 --> 00:30:01,746
Looks like we've got ourselves
our next cockfight.

347
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:08,169
Five, four, three, two, one...

348
00:30:08,336 --> 00:30:09,837
let him go!

349
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:37,407
Get up there!

350
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:48,292
All mine?

351
00:31:13,192 --> 00:31:14,944
Now, wait a minute.

352
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:49,520
You're right. He did stink.

353
00:31:49,687 --> 00:31:51,522
Hey, you can run--

354
00:31:51,689 --> 00:31:53,775
Where's you?

355
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,237
Just had a fight.

356
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:01,866
- Just had a fight.
- Yes.

357
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,659
- Where were you?
- I'm glad to see...

358
00:32:03,826 --> 00:32:06,412
you're taking your best-man duties
so seriously.

359
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:10,249
I was on my own!
Not gonna get my monies!

360
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:11,834
She was biting my leg.

361
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:15,546
I'll have Carruthers put some fuel
into that motor carriage of yours.

362
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:17,381
You do have a wedding to attend.

363
00:32:17,715 --> 00:32:18,758
Oh, I'll drive.

364
00:32:18,925 --> 00:32:20,218
Hmm.

365
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:23,680
Ho-honk. 

366
00:32:24,847 --> 00:32:28,476
- Let's have another drink.
- No, no, I think you've had quite enough.

367
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,014
Present arms!

368
00:34:58,584 --> 00:35:01,170
I've been to a wedding here before.

369
00:35:04,131 --> 00:35:05,841
Funeral too.

370
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,763
The professor wants to meet.

371
00:35:11,597 --> 00:35:15,726
I'd expected to hear from him sooner,
in light of recent events.

372
00:35:16,102 --> 00:35:21,107
He was wondering if it'd be convenient
for you to come by the college this afternoon.

373
00:35:21,273 --> 00:35:23,442
His lecture concludes at 4.

374
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:24,610
Looking forward.

375
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:27,571
One side, chummy.

376
00:35:52,471 --> 00:35:56,642
"Fischerweise," Schubert, 1826.

377
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:07,945
- "Give up your foolish trickery."
- "This fish you cannot cheat."

378
00:36:08,487 --> 00:36:09,822
I hope I'm not intruding.

379
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:13,617
Excuse me. 
Matthew, take these up to Mr. Williams.

380
00:36:13,784 --> 00:36:15,870
And make sure he packs
my white tie and tails.

381
00:36:16,037 --> 00:36:18,831
- I'll take care of it, professor.
- Thank you. I do apologize.

382
00:36:18,998 --> 00:36:23,002
I'm off on a blasted lecture tour.
Would you care for some tea or coffee?

383
00:36:23,169 --> 00:36:25,504
- Neither.
- Something stronger, perhaps?

384
00:36:25,671 --> 00:36:29,467
No, but might I trouble you
for an inscription?

385
00:36:47,651 --> 00:36:51,155
I read that the good doctor
was to be married today.

386
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:52,698
How was the service?

387
00:36:52,865 --> 00:36:54,116
Definitive.

388
00:36:54,283 --> 00:36:58,412
He'll no longer be party to my investigations.
He's out of the equation.

389
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:02,708
I trust you'll take this
into consideration.

390
00:37:06,545 --> 00:37:09,632
And what considerations
will you grant me?

391
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:19,308
Have you actually read the book?

392
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:21,644
I found it compelling...

393
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:26,107
though I'm primarily interested
in your more recent endeavors.

394
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:29,735
I take that as a compliment.

395
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:32,780
I have the utmost regard for your talents.

396
00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:37,034
It's a pleasure to finally meet you...

397
00:37:38,077 --> 00:37:39,161
officially.

398
00:37:42,915 --> 00:37:46,085
Are you familiar
with the study of graphology?

399
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:49,004
I've never given it
any serious thought, no.

400
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:52,758
The psychological analysis of handwriting.

401
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:57,721
The upward strokes on the P, the J, and the M
indicate a genius-level intellect.

402
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,099
While the flourishes on the lower zone...

403
00:38:00,266 --> 00:38:03,310
denote a highly creative
yet meticulous nature.

404
00:38:03,477 --> 00:38:06,814
But if one observes the overall slant
and the pressure of the writing...

405
00:38:06,981 --> 00:38:11,443
there's a suggestion of acute narcissism,
a complete lack of empathy...

406
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,155
- and a pronounced inclination toward--
- No.

407
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:15,739
moral insanity.

408
00:38:16,866 --> 00:38:21,829
In answer to your previous request
regarding Dr. Watson not being involved...

409
00:38:21,996 --> 00:38:24,665
the answer is no.

410
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:31,672
The laws of celestial mechanics dictate
that when two objects collide...

411
00:38:32,298 --> 00:38:36,177
there is always damage
of a collateral nature.

412
00:38:38,387 --> 00:38:40,598
<i>Exempli gratia.</i>

413
00:38:40,764 --> 00:38:44,894
Two gentlemen find themselves
at cross-purposes.

414
00:38:46,645 --> 00:38:49,607
<i>A young woman torn between them.</i>

415
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,737
<i>The strain proves too much for her,
and she suddenly falls ill...</i>

416
00:38:55,446 --> 00:38:59,992
with tragic consequences.

417
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,165
<i>A rare form of tuberculosis.</i>

418
00:39:06,332 --> 00:39:09,960
She succumbed in a matter of seconds.

419
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,256
Now...

420
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:18,636
are you sure you want
to play this game?

421
00:39:20,262 --> 00:39:22,806
I'm afraid you'd lose.

422
00:39:24,725 --> 00:39:30,564
Rest assured, if you attempt
to bring destruction down upon me...

423
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:33,025
I shall do the same to you.

424
00:39:33,484 --> 00:39:38,739
My respect for you, Mr. Holmes,
is the only reason you're still alive.

425
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,701
You've paid me several compliments.

426
00:39:42,868 --> 00:39:47,873
Let me pay you one in return when I say that
if I were assured of the former eventuality...

427
00:39:50,876 --> 00:39:53,128
I would cheerfully accept the latter.

428
00:39:57,007 --> 00:40:00,552
I'll be sure to send my regards
to the happy couple.

429
00:40:04,723 --> 00:40:06,767
Another time, then.

430
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:29,623
All aboard for Brighton!
All aboard!

431
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,041
Which coach are we?

432
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,960
We should be just here.

433
00:40:36,005 --> 00:40:37,840
First class.

434
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:43,304
All aboard for Brighton!
All aboard!

435
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,557
Hurry up, Dr. Watson,
your wife needs you.

436
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:48,892
Coming, Mrs. Watson.

437
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:53,939
Oh. First class, champagne.

438
00:40:54,106 --> 00:40:56,608
You do know how to spoil a girl,
Mr. Watson.

439
00:40:56,775 --> 00:40:58,193
You're not just any girl.

440
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:02,948
I'm sorry, madam. You can't use the lavatory
while the train's in the station.

441
00:41:07,036 --> 00:41:09,288
You're Mrs. Watson.

442
00:41:10,456 --> 00:41:12,624
Give me that bottle.

443
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:30,142
John, there is nowhere else in the world
I would rather be.

444
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:33,062
There's no one I'd rather be with.

445
00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:35,647
Why do you have a gun stuffed down
the back of your trousers?

446
00:41:36,814 --> 00:41:38,559
Old habits.

447
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:43,965
Come in.

448
00:41:46,658 --> 00:41:48,869
- Oh, yes, please.
- We didn't order that.

449
00:41:49,036 --> 00:41:50,287
With our compliments, sir.

450
00:41:51,121 --> 00:41:53,248
Thank you. Put it there.

451
00:42:07,763 --> 00:42:09,056
Open the door, John.

452
00:42:12,601 --> 00:42:14,686
I think it's time for you to leave.

453
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,736
Sit down.

454
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:28,575
Shh.

455
00:42:46,802 --> 00:42:50,806
I agree it's not my best disguise,
but I had to make do.

456
00:42:52,307 --> 00:42:54,309
- My God.
- They'll be back.

457
00:42:54,476 --> 00:42:56,895
- John, shut the door.
- They'll only shoot through it.

458
00:42:57,062 --> 00:42:59,523
- He's right, you know.
- Oh, my God.

459
00:43:00,899 --> 00:43:02,818
- I understand.
- Do you?

460
00:43:02,985 --> 00:43:05,320
Terribly inconvenient.

461
00:43:06,238 --> 00:43:07,739
We don't have much time.

462
00:43:14,246 --> 00:43:16,165
- How many are we expecting?
- Half a dozen.

463
00:43:16,331 --> 00:43:18,750
- Who are they?
- A wedding present from Moriarty.

464
00:43:19,585 --> 00:43:21,795
Lovely ceremony, by the way.
Many a tear shed in joy.

465
00:43:21,962 --> 00:43:23,005
Oh, John?

466
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:25,549
Yeah, just a minute, darling.

467
00:43:25,716 --> 00:43:28,051
- Do you trust me?
- No.

468
00:43:28,218 --> 00:43:31,889
Well, then I shall have to do
something about that.

469
00:43:38,937 --> 00:43:40,814
Who's up to bat next, you bastards?

470
00:43:42,191 --> 00:43:43,859
Send out the fast bowler!

471
00:43:44,026 --> 00:43:45,527
John, do shut the door.

472
00:43:51,366 --> 00:43:52,784
It had to be done.

473
00:43:53,827 --> 00:43:55,746
She's safe now.

474
00:43:58,499 --> 00:44:00,417
In my own defense,
I timed it perfectly.

475
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,879
Did you kill my wife?!

476
00:44:04,046 --> 00:44:07,174
Did you just kill my new wife?!

477
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:09,176
Of course not!

478
00:44:10,135 --> 00:44:14,598
What do you mean? How do you know that
when you just threw her off a train?

479
00:44:14,765 --> 00:44:16,975
I told you, I timed it perfectly.

480
00:44:17,142 --> 00:44:18,352
What does that mean?!

481
00:44:22,523 --> 00:44:24,233
- Calm down.
- Explain!

482
00:44:24,399 --> 00:44:26,568
By the time I've explained,
we'd both be dead!

483
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:42,417
I'm sorry, madam. You can't use the lavatory
while the train's in the station.

484
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:37,222
That was no accident.

485
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:41,101
It was by design.

486
00:45:43,812 --> 00:45:48,191
Now, do you need me to elaborate...

487
00:45:49,568 --> 00:45:52,070
or can we just crack on?

488
00:45:58,952 --> 00:46:00,412
Come on!

489
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,834
Don't worry, old boy,
she's as safe as houses.

490
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:08,086
She's with my brother.

491
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,214
I'm on my honeymoon!

492
00:46:11,381 --> 00:46:14,593
Why did you lead them here?!
Why did you involve us?!

493
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,845
They aren't here for me!
They're here for you!

494
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:24,811
Fortunately...

495
00:46:31,818 --> 00:46:33,278
so am I.

496
00:46:33,445 --> 00:46:34,821
Now mind the door.

497
00:46:36,323 --> 00:46:37,908
Good evening.

498
00:46:40,118 --> 00:46:43,497
I think you'll find that second class
is more comfortable.

499
00:46:43,663 --> 00:46:45,624
The coast is clear.

500
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:47,292
To the south, quick march.

501
00:46:55,342 --> 00:46:57,302
Lie down with me, Watson.

502
00:46:57,969 --> 00:47:00,305
- Why?
- I insist.

503
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:08,939
What are we doing down here?

504
00:47:09,231 --> 00:47:12,317
We are waiting. I am smoking.

505
00:47:32,379 --> 00:47:35,507
- Patiently waiting.
- For what?

506
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:39,469
Your window of opportunity.

507
00:47:46,184 --> 00:47:47,602
Make it count.

508
00:47:55,026 --> 00:47:59,197
I said make it count.
How many windows must I provide?

509
00:48:20,051 --> 00:48:23,638
Who'd have known that honeymooning in Brighton
was such a dangerous notion?

510
00:48:23,805 --> 00:48:25,515
Is that what this is about?

511
00:48:25,682 --> 00:48:28,101
By your own admission,
you've never enjoyed it there.

512
00:48:28,268 --> 00:48:29,853
I've never been to Brighton.

513
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,898
Or you're just too fragile
to remember at present.

514
00:48:33,064 --> 00:48:34,858
Oh, shut up.

515
00:48:35,025 --> 00:48:36,234
Tell me my wife's safe.

516
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:38,111
I can't do both.

517
00:48:38,278 --> 00:48:41,698
I promise. As I said,
I timed it perfectly.

518
00:48:48,663 --> 00:48:51,416
Over here, madam!

519
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:56,046
I believe congratulations are in order,
Mrs. Watson.

520
00:48:58,632 --> 00:49:01,635
I'm the other Holmes.

521
00:49:02,636 --> 00:49:04,012
You mean there's two of you?

522
00:49:04,179 --> 00:49:06,890
How marvelous.
Could this evening get any better?

523
00:49:07,057 --> 00:49:09,309
Why were Mary and I targeted at all?

524
00:49:09,768 --> 00:49:12,812
Excellent question.
The answer is twofold.

525
00:49:12,979 --> 00:49:14,898
He's after us because of you.

526
00:49:15,065 --> 00:49:17,859
I'm afraid you must bear
half the responsibility.

527
00:49:18,026 --> 00:49:20,445
- Here it comes. So predictable.
- Had you and Mary...

528
00:49:20,612 --> 00:49:23,573
not been hell-bent on wedding,
we could've solved this case.

529
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,284
- Oh, it's my fault now.
- The argument could be made...

530
00:49:26,451 --> 00:49:29,120
- No, it couldn't.
- that your nuptials were poorly timed.

531
00:49:30,914 --> 00:49:32,999
Thus, our relationship--

532
00:49:34,334 --> 00:49:35,377
Relationship?

533
00:49:36,086 --> 00:49:37,671
Very well, partnership.

534
00:49:37,837 --> 00:49:40,924
has not yet run its course.

535
00:49:41,341 --> 00:49:45,136
My dear fellow, if you could be bothered
to see this through to the end...

536
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:48,890
I shall never again ask you
to assist me.

537
00:49:53,853 --> 00:49:56,481
Once more unto the breach.

538
00:49:56,648 --> 00:49:58,942
That's the spirit.
Now, to the question.

539
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:02,112
This is so deliciously complicated.
You may be asking yourself...

540
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:06,283
what does a criminal mastermind want
with a simple gypsy fortune teller?

541
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:09,744
It's her brother, I tell you.
When we find him, and we must--

542
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:11,496
After you find my luggage.

543
00:50:13,415 --> 00:50:14,624
Go on.

544
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:16,459
Wait.

545
00:50:17,002 --> 00:50:18,378
Where is it we're going?

546
00:50:18,878 --> 00:50:22,507
Paris, the most sensible
honeymoon destination of all.

547
00:50:46,364 --> 00:50:49,034
- So why Paris?
- Peaches.

548
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,785
Outside the city at Montreuil...

549
00:50:50,952 --> 00:50:55,790
there's a Gypsy camp famous
for its dried fruit, especially peaches.

550
00:50:56,875 --> 00:51:01,129
And there we shall find our fortune teller...

551
00:51:01,296 --> 00:51:03,506
and return her bag.

552
00:52:19,457 --> 00:52:21,960
And my ticket?

553
00:52:34,514 --> 00:52:37,851
Unfortunately, you won't be needing yours.

554
00:52:38,184 --> 00:52:43,481
That's a shame, professor.
I was looking forward to <i>Don Giovanni.</i>

555
00:52:52,657 --> 00:52:54,826
Follow Meinhard.

556
00:53:34,407 --> 00:53:35,450
Wake up, we're here.

557
00:53:35,617 --> 00:53:37,827
Brace yourself.
We're about to be violated.

558
00:53:37,994 --> 00:53:39,996
Don't be so cynical.

559
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,550
- They're taking my luggage.
- Laugh them away, Watson. I have her bag.

560
00:53:55,386 --> 00:53:58,097
You had her bag.

561
00:53:59,015 --> 00:54:00,183
Now they have my coat.

562
00:54:01,518 --> 00:54:03,686
Where is Madam Simza?

563
00:54:06,523 --> 00:54:07,899
This is Simza.

564
00:54:14,072 --> 00:54:15,865
Sim is a goose.

565
00:54:17,534 --> 00:54:18,568
I am Sim.

566
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:26,167
Nice scarf. I like.

567
00:54:49,649 --> 00:54:51,734
- You hungry?
- Famished.

568
00:54:56,781 --> 00:54:59,284
Madam, this is a glorious hedgehog goulash.

569
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:03,037
I can't remember ever having had better.

570
00:55:06,457 --> 00:55:10,295
Do tell me, when was the last time
you had a hedgehog goulash?

571
00:55:10,461 --> 00:55:13,006
I told you, Watson,
I can't remember.

572
00:55:13,172 --> 00:55:14,924
Perhaps you've repressed it.

573
00:55:16,342 --> 00:55:19,721
That's where we differ.
Unlike you, I repress nothing.

574
00:55:19,888 --> 00:55:21,472
Perfectly normal.

575
00:55:22,223 --> 00:55:26,477
How dare you be rude to this woman
who has invited us into her tent...

576
00:55:26,644 --> 00:55:28,229
offered us her hedgehog?

577
00:55:28,396 --> 00:55:32,150
Says the man who throws women from trains.

578
00:55:33,985 --> 00:55:35,194
Who are you two?

579
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,071
Concerned citizens.

580
00:55:38,072 --> 00:55:39,949
Why did someone try to kill me?

581
00:55:40,909 --> 00:55:44,537
Your brother has become involved
with a very dangerous man...

582
00:55:44,704 --> 00:55:48,374
who clearly believes that Rene
has told you something you shouldn't know.

583
00:55:50,335 --> 00:55:51,669
I don't know anything.

584
00:55:53,129 --> 00:55:55,590
I've been looking for him for over a year.

585
00:55:55,757 --> 00:55:57,884
That was why I was in London.

586
00:55:58,051 --> 00:56:01,638
- It's the last place anyone saw him.
- It's clear that your brother loves you.

587
00:56:01,804 --> 00:56:04,766
He'd never send you a message
that would put you in harm's way.

588
00:56:04,933 --> 00:56:08,645
Any information, therefore, would be,
by default, unintentional.

589
00:56:09,062 --> 00:56:10,897
Has he sent you anything else?

590
00:56:11,981 --> 00:56:13,316
Just a few drawings.

591
00:56:13,858 --> 00:56:15,944
Let's just see what they have to tell us.

592
00:56:22,992 --> 00:56:27,121
Unusual choice of paper.
Thicker gauge, designed for a printing press.

593
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:30,083
- And it's the same stock as the letter.
- Mm.

594
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:32,418
They smell musty.

595
00:56:32,585 --> 00:56:36,172
Must have been stored
somewhere cold and damp.

596
00:56:36,714 --> 00:56:38,883
What's that? Blood?

597
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:45,056
Wine. So a wine cellar located
near a printing press.

598
00:56:45,223 --> 00:56:46,641
That should narrow it down.

599
00:56:51,604 --> 00:56:55,149
There's a wine cellar used
by the anarchist group <i>Lapin Vert.</i>

600
00:56:55,316 --> 00:56:57,694
Rene was close to their leader.

601
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,278
Claude Ravache.

602
00:56:59,445 --> 00:57:02,949
- A bomb maker.
- I sampled some of his work last week.

603
00:57:04,409 --> 00:57:08,204
I was a part of the movement.
So was Rene.

604
00:57:08,371 --> 00:57:10,915
Until it became too extreme for us.

605
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:14,252
Ravache knows me.

606
00:57:14,585 --> 00:57:18,965
If my brother's back there,
he will see us.

607
00:57:19,132 --> 00:57:20,258
We will send a message.

608
00:57:30,143 --> 00:57:33,312
Whatever you do,
don't let these gypsies make you drink.

609
00:57:33,479 --> 00:57:34,522
Of course.

610
00:57:35,106 --> 00:57:36,441
You dance?

611
00:57:37,275 --> 00:57:40,278
For God's sake, don't dance.
It'll be the death of you.

612
00:57:45,742 --> 00:57:47,201
You know what happens when you dance.

613
00:58:14,395 --> 00:58:16,355
Oh, good morning, Mrs. Watson.

614
00:58:16,981 --> 00:58:18,566
- Have you had breakfast?
- I--

615
00:58:18,733 --> 00:58:21,485
Stanley here does
a wonderful deviled kidney.

616
00:58:23,112 --> 00:58:24,864
- Carruthers?
- Morning, sir.

617
00:58:25,031 --> 00:58:27,450
Telegram for Mrs. Watson.

618
00:58:33,998 --> 00:58:35,083
Uh....

619
00:58:35,249 --> 00:58:36,959
It just doesn't make any sense.

620
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,503
Allow me.

621
00:58:40,213 --> 00:58:41,339
Oh, yes.

622
00:58:41,506 --> 00:58:45,843
"My most loathed Mary, I do not love you.
I never wish to see you again.

623
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:50,098
Every moment I count away from you
is a blessing."

624
00:58:50,264 --> 00:58:52,892
Fret not.
It's a double encryption, my dear...

625
00:58:53,059 --> 00:58:56,229
that Sherly and I have used
since we were boys.

626
00:58:56,395 --> 00:58:59,357
If the first letter of the message
is a consonant...

627
00:58:59,524 --> 00:59:02,568
then what follows is the mirrored truth.

628
00:59:02,735 --> 00:59:04,028
- I see.
- Hmm.

629
00:59:05,822 --> 00:59:07,532
Stanley!

630
00:59:08,366 --> 00:59:11,619
You know, although our time together
has been but a brief interlude...

631
00:59:11,786 --> 00:59:16,040
I'm beginning to understand
how a man of particular disposition...

632
00:59:16,207 --> 00:59:21,129
under certain circumstances,
extreme ones perhaps...

633
00:59:21,295 --> 00:59:25,508
might grow to enjoy the company of...

634
00:59:25,675 --> 00:59:31,681
- a person of your gender. Hmm.
- Hmm.

635
00:59:31,848 --> 00:59:33,724
Thank you so much.

636
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:36,018
Most charming.

637
00:59:36,561 --> 00:59:39,772
May--? Terribly sorry.
Thank you.

638
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,484
Where are you going, Stanley?

639
00:59:59,876 --> 01:00:02,044
Whoa, whoa.

640
01:00:52,637 --> 01:00:54,555
Still hiding in basements?

641
01:01:04,815 --> 01:01:06,776
I'm not here to see you.

642
01:01:09,987 --> 01:01:10,988
Yeah.

643
01:01:14,825 --> 01:01:16,410
...with your English friends.

644
01:01:19,205 --> 01:01:22,583
1789, a seminal vintage.

645
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,835
The year of our glorious revolution.

646
01:01:25,002 --> 01:01:27,505
- Is he here?
- When freedom triumphed over tyranny.

647
01:01:27,672 --> 01:01:28,673
Is my brother here?

648
01:01:29,799 --> 01:01:32,301
I haven't seen him for a long time.

649
01:01:32,468 --> 01:01:33,511
You're lying.

650
01:01:34,762 --> 01:01:36,681
Sit, please.

651
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,728
A letter was received from Rene
using this same paper.

652
01:01:42,895 --> 01:01:45,106
Of course. He took it with him
wherever he went.

653
01:01:46,399 --> 01:01:48,359
He's telling the truth.
Rene isn't here.

654
01:01:48,526 --> 01:01:51,821
- He was given another assignment by an--
- An anonymous benefactor.

655
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,367
Another Englishman...

656
01:01:56,909 --> 01:02:00,705
with money, power,
who supported our cause.

657
01:02:01,414 --> 01:02:02,915
And now...

658
01:02:03,541 --> 01:02:06,335
he dictates our every move...

659
01:02:11,841 --> 01:02:16,470
demanding I take responsibility
for his acts of terror.

660
01:02:17,179 --> 01:02:18,973
I made a deal with the devil.

661
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,975
But after tonight...

662
01:02:22,184 --> 01:02:23,477
it will be over.

663
01:02:25,229 --> 01:02:27,189
My job is almost done.

664
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,695
He's had you plant another bomb,
hasn't he?

665
01:02:32,862 --> 01:02:34,488
Claude, please.

666
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,282
These men can help you.

667
01:02:37,074 --> 01:02:39,035
I wish they could.

668
01:02:39,744 --> 01:02:41,662
You see, gentlemen...

669
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:44,540
he has my wife and children.

670
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,626
If you tell us where the bomb is...

671
01:02:47,793 --> 01:02:51,088
- I'll find a way to help your family.
- That's already taken care of.

672
01:02:51,589 --> 01:02:53,466
We have a deal.

673
01:02:56,218 --> 01:02:58,220
He and I.

674
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,390
No loose ends.

675
01:03:02,016 --> 01:03:05,227
There's only one thing I can do
to keep my family safe.

676
01:03:05,936 --> 01:03:08,647
- You have less than 10 minutes.
- Don't!

677
01:03:20,659 --> 01:03:24,955
He has no further need of that pistol.
Why don't you take it and cover the stairs?

678
01:03:57,947 --> 01:03:59,782
There's only one way out of this place.

679
01:04:01,492 --> 01:04:02,576
Right you are.

680
01:04:07,206 --> 01:04:09,375
Ah. Ingenious.

681
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:11,627
That's the one.
Quickly as we can.

682
01:04:14,755 --> 01:04:17,383
You know what to do with that sandbag, Watson.

683
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:19,885
Quick now.

684
01:04:27,143 --> 01:04:29,145
Doctor, could you secure that lever?

685
01:04:30,521 --> 01:04:31,814
You could have told me.

686
01:04:32,565 --> 01:04:36,360
Ravache was strong. He lived for liberty.
He would never take his own life.

687
01:04:36,527 --> 01:04:37,653
Calm yourself.

688
01:04:43,909 --> 01:04:45,786
My brother, he's weak.

689
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:49,540
Sim, I need you to take a deep breath...

690
01:04:49,707 --> 01:04:50,916
and follow us.

691
01:04:53,544 --> 01:04:55,296
To the opera.

692
01:07:29,617 --> 01:07:31,619
I was mistaken.

693
01:07:31,785 --> 01:07:34,913
- What?
- I made a mistake.

694
01:09:25,107 --> 01:09:26,692
He took the shot from here.

695
01:09:28,485 --> 01:09:31,321
Using a tripod and a shooting stick.

696
01:09:31,488 --> 01:09:34,366
And realized there was a better position.

697
01:09:34,867 --> 01:09:39,997
There's a faint scrape
where he dragged his tripod and set it up here.

698
01:09:40,831 --> 01:09:43,083
- Six hundred yards?
- Or 650?

699
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,711
 Not to mention a seven-
or eight-mile-an-hour wind.

700
01:09:45,878 --> 01:09:48,380
He would've needed a wind gauge.

701
01:09:49,214 --> 01:09:50,758
Which he placed here.

702
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:55,345
And put a cigarette down here.

703
01:09:57,556 --> 01:09:59,141
Can anyone shoot that far?

704
01:09:59,308 --> 01:10:02,019
Not more than half a dozen men
in all of Europe.

705
01:10:03,103 --> 01:10:05,147
How many of those men served in Afghanistan?

706
01:10:05,314 --> 01:10:07,900
- Why?
- Hirschsprung with a touch of Tekel.

707
01:10:08,066 --> 01:10:10,319
<i>Must have fallen out
when he was rolling up.</i>

708
01:10:10,486 --> 01:10:12,362
Wasn't that the blend you all smoked?

709
01:10:14,531 --> 01:10:17,493
- Didn't I read something about a colonel?
- Sebastian Moran.

710
01:10:18,619 --> 01:10:20,829
<i>Best marksman in the British army.</i>

711
01:10:20,996 --> 01:10:22,998
Dishonorable discharge.

712
01:10:23,165 --> 01:10:27,836
He's likely now a gun for hire.
This is the second victim of his that I've encountered.

713
01:10:28,003 --> 01:10:29,713
What better way to conceal a killing?

714
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,216
No one looks for a bullet hole
in a bomb blast.

715
01:10:45,938 --> 01:10:48,232
- He's 20 minutes late.
- He must come soon.

716
01:10:49,233 --> 01:10:50,442
I don't have any papers.

717
01:10:50,943 --> 01:10:52,778
And I am a foreigner.

718
01:10:52,945 --> 01:10:55,239
This climate is exactly what Moriarty wants.

719
01:10:56,105 --> 01:10:59,159
The omelet fines herbes was divine... 

720
01:10:59,326 --> 01:11:01,912
but they spared every expense on the tea.

721
01:11:02,746 --> 01:11:06,959
Now shall we compare moods,
or consider what we know?

722
01:11:08,085 --> 01:11:09,962
<i>Last night's bombing
was clearly meant...</i>

723
01:11:10,128 --> 01:11:13,048
<i>to look like Germany's retaliation
for Strasbourg.</i>

724
01:11:13,215 --> 01:11:16,927
<i>However, the bomb was also meant
to conceal the murder of just one man.</i>

725
01:11:17,511 --> 01:11:21,598
The man killed by the gunshot
was none other than Alfred Meinhard.

726
01:11:24,434 --> 01:11:27,646
He makes guns. Big guns.

727
01:11:28,105 --> 01:11:32,150
Only days ago, a large share of his company
was bought by an unknown investor.

728
01:11:32,317 --> 01:11:33,485
Moriarty.

729
01:11:33,652 --> 01:11:38,198
The clues point in one direction,
but to avoid repeating last night's debacle...

730
01:11:38,365 --> 01:11:42,244
I was obliged to collect more sufficient data,
hence my tardiness.

731
01:11:49,209 --> 01:11:52,462
Train departs in 40 minutes, sir.

732
01:12:07,561 --> 01:12:08,854
Whoa!

733
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:20,449
- Just the bags.
- But....

734
01:12:20,616 --> 01:12:23,577
We have enough time for me
to indulge my little habit.

735
01:12:23,744 --> 01:12:24,786
Yes.

736
01:12:24,953 --> 01:12:30,125
<i>His habit of feeding that urban species,
the feral pigeon.</i>

737
01:12:32,127 --> 01:12:35,297
So there are seven
mainline railway stations in Paris.

738
01:12:35,464 --> 01:12:38,342
But taking 10 minutes to get
to the Jardin des Tuileries...

739
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:42,137
where the largest concentration
of the winged vermin may be found...

740
01:12:42,304 --> 01:12:45,390
reduces there to one,
the Gare du Nord...

741
01:12:45,557 --> 01:12:50,729
where he will be just in time
to catch the 11:04 train to Berlin.

742
01:12:50,896 --> 01:12:53,440
It makes several stops along the way,
one of which is--

743
01:12:53,607 --> 01:12:55,317
Heilbronn.

744
01:12:56,068 --> 01:12:58,570
Exactly where we must go.

745
01:12:59,029 --> 01:13:00,530
Where Meinhard's factory is.

746
01:13:00,697 --> 01:13:02,699
It's Moriarty's factory now.

747
01:13:03,367 --> 01:13:05,035
Unfortunately, due to the bombing...

748
01:13:05,202 --> 01:13:07,955
the crossing between France and Germany
is to be closed.

749
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:12,918
I'm afraid our pursuit is over
unless we can happen upon a comrade...

750
01:13:13,085 --> 01:13:16,713
who knows their way around borders.

751
01:13:18,131 --> 01:13:19,549
Too English.

752
01:13:21,885 --> 01:13:24,221
However, you do make a fantastic gypsy.

753
01:13:24,388 --> 01:13:26,390
Certainly smell like a fantastic gypsy.

754
01:13:26,556 --> 01:13:29,351
Now, now, no need to be demeaning.

755
01:13:29,559 --> 01:13:31,728
It is a nice scarf.

756
01:13:31,895 --> 01:13:34,564
No, no, too English.
It'll suit you more.

757
01:13:35,899 --> 01:13:38,735
Black one is yours.
Gray one is mine.

758
01:13:38,902 --> 01:13:41,863
- And this is for you.
- Um... Hmm.

759
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:43,198
Right.

760
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:46,660
- Where are the wagons?
- The wagon is too slow.

761
01:13:46,827 --> 01:13:48,245
Can't you ride?

762
01:13:50,831 --> 01:13:53,041
It's not that he can't ride.

763
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:54,584
How is it you put it, Holmes?

764
01:13:54,751 --> 01:13:58,422
They're dangerous at both ends
and crafty in the middle.

765
01:13:58,588 --> 01:14:02,926
Why would I want anything with a mind of its own 
bobbing about between my legs?

766
01:14:03,093 --> 01:14:05,595
Then I shall require a bicycle,
thank you very much.

767
01:14:05,762 --> 01:14:08,890
It's 1891.
Could've chartered a balloon.

768
01:14:11,518 --> 01:14:13,687
How can we make this more manageable?

769
01:14:26,658 --> 01:14:28,118
Where's the fire?

770
01:14:37,002 --> 01:14:39,963
It's not as if Germany is going somewhere.

771
01:14:49,181 --> 01:14:50,390
We know another way.

772
01:14:56,438 --> 01:14:59,274
Slow and steady wins the race.

773
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:18,251
Come on!

774
01:15:33,642 --> 01:15:37,854
We slip in through the loading bay,
find out what he's doing...

775
01:15:38,021 --> 01:15:39,815
and we get out.

776
01:15:39,981 --> 01:15:41,650
Getting out might be tricky.

777
01:15:41,817 --> 01:15:43,235
We will get you out.

778
01:15:43,401 --> 01:15:46,404
If my brother's in there,
get him out alive.

779
01:16:03,046 --> 01:16:04,297
Are you happy?

780
01:16:05,799 --> 01:16:07,634
- What?
- At this moment...

781
01:16:07,801 --> 01:16:11,763
are you as happy as you would be
on your honeymoon in Brighton?

782
01:16:12,264 --> 01:16:15,058
I'm not going to grace that question
with an answer.

783
01:16:17,602 --> 01:16:20,146
- Are you happy?
- I think we're here for another reason.

784
01:16:20,313 --> 01:16:21,523
- Okay.
- Shall we get on--?

785
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:23,525
- Simple question.
- Will we do something?

786
01:16:23,692 --> 01:16:26,236
- Or wait for them to come back round?
- What time is it?

787
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:28,613
- Three-fifteen.
- Over there...

788
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:32,117
in the residential part of the complex
should be a telegraph office.

789
01:16:32,284 --> 01:16:35,662
Send this to Mycroft.
Be back here on the hour.

790
01:19:25,832 --> 01:19:30,295
That's what you get, Mr. Holmes,
when industry marries arms.

791
01:19:30,462 --> 01:19:32,672
Now put your gun down.

792
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,967
It's a bit old-fashioned.

793
01:19:40,805 --> 01:19:42,640
What you need is one of these.

794
01:19:44,267 --> 01:19:45,769
Go on.

795
01:19:48,021 --> 01:19:49,105
Pick one.

796
01:19:51,941 --> 01:19:54,903
Machine pistol, self-repeating.

797
01:19:56,571 --> 01:20:00,075
Takes 7.63 caliber rounds...

798
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:02,744
in one of these.

799
01:20:05,538 --> 01:20:07,832
A 10-shot box magazine.

800
01:20:09,876 --> 01:20:12,462
- Easy enough to load.
- Hmm.

801
01:20:12,629 --> 01:20:16,007
I'd imagine one would have to retract the bolt
to engage the first round.

802
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:18,927
Easier done than said.

803
01:20:28,353 --> 01:20:29,896
Take him to the surgery.

804
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:33,650
I'll find the doctor.

805
01:20:44,702 --> 01:20:46,996
"Come at once if convenient.

806
01:20:49,374 --> 01:20:52,418
If inconvenient, come all the same."

807
01:21:04,305 --> 01:21:05,348
This is schnapps.

808
01:21:06,599 --> 01:21:09,686
A telegram was sent from here.

809
01:21:11,062 --> 01:21:14,899
This isn't schnapps, it's aquavit,
distilled from potato mash.

810
01:21:15,066 --> 01:21:17,569
A common misconception.
Thank you, by the way.

811
01:21:18,361 --> 01:21:20,363
Who was it sent to?

812
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:22,490
My horror at your crimes
is matched only...

813
01:21:22,657 --> 01:21:25,577
by my admiration at the skill
it took to achieve them.

814
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:28,872
Who was it sent to?

815
01:21:30,039 --> 01:21:33,626
<i>You used the anarchists and their bombs
to create a crisis in Europe...</i>

816
01:21:33,793 --> 01:21:35,253
<i>nation against nation.</i>

817
01:21:35,587 --> 01:21:39,174
Under various pseudonyms,
you bought, schemed, or murdered your way...

818
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:42,927
into numerous industries,
assuring that none of it could be traced to you.

819
01:21:43,386 --> 01:21:47,348
<i>Cotton, opium, steel,
now arms and chemical weaponry.</i>

820
01:21:47,515 --> 01:21:50,768
<i>All to be shipped across Europe
in less than a week.</i>

821
01:21:50,935 --> 01:21:53,146
<i>Everything from bullets to bandages.</i>

822
01:21:54,147 --> 01:21:57,901
Now that you own the supply,
you intend to create the demand.

823
01:21:59,944 --> 01:22:01,279
A world war.

824
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,577
<i>You are familiar with Schubert's work.</i>

825
01:22:12,248 --> 01:22:16,211
<i>The Trout</i> is perhaps my favorite.

826
01:22:18,213 --> 01:22:23,092
A fisherman grows weary
of trying to catch an elusive fish.

827
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:26,387
Out the way, out the way.

828
01:22:27,472 --> 01:22:28,890
So he muddies the water.

829
01:22:29,515 --> 01:22:31,017
I'm warning you.

830
01:22:31,517 --> 01:22:32,977
Confuses the fish.

831
01:22:38,858 --> 01:22:40,068
You were warned.

832
01:22:40,235 --> 01:22:44,113
It doesn't realize until too late
that it has swum into a trap.

833
01:24:29,093 --> 01:24:31,137
Let's try this again, shall we?

834
01:24:31,554 --> 01:24:35,266
To whom did you send the telegram?

835
01:24:36,017 --> 01:24:37,769
To my....

836
01:24:50,698 --> 01:24:52,742
To my brother Mycroft.

837
01:24:55,953 --> 01:24:57,580
What are you playing at?

838
01:25:01,793 --> 01:25:03,920
That's not fair.

839
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:07,799
I've just got one more question for you.

840
01:25:14,138 --> 01:25:16,015
Which one of us is the fisherman...

841
01:25:16,849 --> 01:25:18,684
and which the trout?

842
01:25:49,423 --> 01:25:50,550
Holmes?

843
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:53,928
Holmes?

844
01:25:54,095 --> 01:25:57,431
Take your time. Take your time.

845
01:26:02,603 --> 01:26:03,855
Uh....

846
01:26:10,403 --> 01:26:12,071
Always good to see you, Watson.

847
01:26:27,628 --> 01:26:29,213
- What were you thinking?
- Wait.

848
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:30,590
Wait?

849
01:26:32,133 --> 01:26:36,679
Well, if you must know, I was thinking
I had him right where I wanted him.

850
01:26:40,683 --> 01:26:43,269
Right. Crack on, then.

851
01:26:49,442 --> 01:26:50,693
Professor.

852
01:26:51,194 --> 01:26:53,654
I'm all right, I'm all right.

853
01:26:53,821 --> 01:26:56,532
Don't waste time attending to me.

854
01:27:00,995 --> 01:27:03,456
I'll find them. I'll find them.

855
01:27:10,338 --> 01:27:12,965
Turn in three, two, one.

856
01:27:21,724 --> 01:27:22,725
Come on, hurry up!

857
01:27:26,938 --> 01:27:28,272
Go!

858
01:27:37,615 --> 01:27:40,576
- Did you see my brother?
- No, but I'm certain he's been here.

859
01:27:40,743 --> 01:27:42,495
- Where are we going?
- Over that wall.

860
01:27:42,662 --> 01:27:45,081
- How did you know I'd find you?
- You didn't find me.

861
01:27:45,248 --> 01:27:47,083
You collapsed a building on me.

862
01:28:39,927 --> 01:28:41,804
- Where are the horses?
- They're behind.

863
01:28:41,971 --> 01:28:44,390
- We need them.
- You wanna go back?

864
01:28:44,557 --> 01:28:45,766
What's our way out?

865
01:28:45,933 --> 01:28:47,310
That's our way out.

866
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:09,900
Go! Go!

867
01:32:11,777 --> 01:32:13,028
Come on!

868
01:32:28,794 --> 01:32:31,213
Marko! Marko!

869
01:33:22,973 --> 01:33:24,099
He's not breathing.

870
01:33:32,858 --> 01:33:33,900
Cradle his head.

871
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,153
Raise his legs.

872
01:33:37,988 --> 01:33:40,657
Bloody well not gonna die on me.

873
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,455
I'm not gonna make this easy on you.

874
01:33:49,082 --> 01:33:51,585
Come on. Come on.

875
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:53,420
Come on.

876
01:33:58,425 --> 01:33:59,509
Come on.

877
01:33:59,676 --> 01:34:01,887
I know you can hear me,
you selfish bastard.

878
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:03,972
Come on!

879
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:06,433
I know you can hear me, you bastard.

880
01:34:26,745 --> 01:34:27,913
His wedding gift.

881
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:51,186
Terrible dream.

882
01:34:51,353 --> 01:34:53,563
You, Mary, Gladstone and I
were in a restaurant.

883
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:56,775
That satanic pony was there as well,
a massive fork in his hoof...

884
01:34:56,942 --> 01:34:58,902
and he turned on me!

885
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:00,987
What have you administered?

886
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:02,948
Your wedding present.

887
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:05,367
Who's been dancing on my chest?!

888
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:06,826
Me.

889
01:35:07,661 --> 01:35:09,287
Why is my ankle so itchy?

890
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:11,873
You have a large piece of wood
sticking out of it.

891
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:14,084
Good Lord. You, Tamas.

892
01:35:14,251 --> 01:35:17,462
I have an important job to discuss with you.
Remind me of it later.

893
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:20,382
Sit down. Drink this.

894
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:23,134
I need to get that out
before it turns septic.

895
01:35:26,513 --> 01:35:29,849
- Did you call me "selfish bastard"?
- Probably.

896
01:35:30,642 --> 01:35:32,602
Just leave it in. Leave it--!

897
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:37,565
You are a--

898
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:40,652
- Oh, you are some sort of--
- Be nice.

899
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:51,204
I'm sorry you didn't get to Brighton.

900
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:56,501
Me too.

901
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:05,343
- I think we should go home.
- I concur.

902
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:08,054
We're going home.

903
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:16,229
Via Switzerland.

904
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:22,610
What better place to start a war
than a peace summit?

905
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:28,992
We'll drop in and see my brother.
I'm sure he's missed you. Hm?

906
01:36:45,592 --> 01:36:47,969
I don't understand why you don't
cancel the summit.

907
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:50,555
Fact is it's gonna happen
whether we like it or not.

908
01:36:50,889 --> 01:36:52,807
Everyone has already arrived.

909
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:55,185
Although these gentlemen
may be talking peace...

910
01:36:55,352 --> 01:36:57,771
believe me, they're readying
their armies at home.

911
01:36:57,937 --> 01:37:00,398
To cancel the summit now
would be tantamount to war.

912
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:03,902
- The telegram, wasn't it clear?
- We have doubled the security, sir.

913
01:37:04,069 --> 01:37:06,237
Oh, doubled security.
That's comforting.

914
01:37:06,404 --> 01:37:09,282
You don't understand
the delicacy of the situation.

915
01:37:09,449 --> 01:37:11,326
I passed the telegram on to my superiors.

916
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:15,205
But they brought Moriarty in to advise
on the peace process in the first place.

917
01:37:15,372 --> 01:37:17,499
He has positioned himself brilliantly.

918
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:20,377
He's one of our foremost intellectuals,
he's a personal friend--

919
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:22,712
Of the prime minister.
Yes, we all know that.

920
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:25,715
I believe you,
but where's your evidence?

921
01:37:26,925 --> 01:37:29,719
He's too good to leave evidence.

922
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:31,262
He doesn't leave loose ends.

923
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:34,307
Oh, he's alive.

924
01:37:34,474 --> 01:37:35,600
Sherly, put that down.

925
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:39,687
What is this contraption? May I have it?
The effect is most invigorating.

926
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:43,900
That's my private and personal supply of oxygen,
and you're not to touch it.

927
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:47,278
This argument is getting us nowhere.

928
01:37:47,445 --> 01:37:51,366
I've arranged for documents to be prepared
which allow you into the ball. Carruthers.

929
01:37:51,533 --> 01:37:54,536
Stanley, Stanley.

930
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:59,082
You haven't aged a day.
Is that my favorite chutney?

931
01:37:59,249 --> 01:38:02,252
Fact is, we don't really know
what he's planning.

932
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:05,588
- It won't be another bomb.
- No, it wouldn't be.

933
01:38:05,755 --> 01:38:07,257
It doesn't make sense.

934
01:38:07,424 --> 01:38:10,051
Why would he attack all the nations
only to unite them?

935
01:38:10,218 --> 01:38:11,594
It'll be an assassination.

936
01:38:12,971 --> 01:38:15,098
By a lone gunman at close range.

937
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:18,059
Rene.

938
01:38:18,768 --> 01:38:20,186
Unfortunately, yes.

939
01:38:21,438 --> 01:38:23,773
- You knew.
- I had my suspicions.

940
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:26,985
But having seen who would be attending,
I'm now certain.

941
01:38:27,152 --> 01:38:29,821
Well, at least we know
who to look out for.

942
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:31,656
Rene will be the evidence.

943
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:35,535
If we can find him and stop him,
we will perhaps not only save his life...

944
01:38:35,702 --> 01:38:38,830
but prevent the collapse
of Western civilization.

945
01:38:39,664 --> 01:38:41,040
No pressure.

946
01:39:13,698 --> 01:39:15,700
Welcome, ambassador.

947
01:39:17,577 --> 01:39:19,871
Professor James Moriarty.

948
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:36,679
Now we're all present...

949
01:39:36,846 --> 01:39:40,642
I can tell you that the targets are the
German chancellor and his ambassador...

950
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:42,894
the French prime minister and his man.

951
01:39:43,061 --> 01:39:47,440
And the other nations are really working out
which side to take should hostilities erupt.

952
01:39:47,607 --> 01:39:50,860
Prince Michael, a cousin of the czar,
and the Russian ambassador.

953
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:53,821
The Archduke Karl Ludwig
and the Austro-Hungarian ambassador.

954
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:57,283
The Romanian Prime Minister
and his ambassador.

955
01:39:57,450 --> 01:40:00,870
And of course our prime minister
and the British ambassador.

956
01:40:01,037 --> 01:40:04,916
He'll choose a moment when the dignitaries
are assembled, preferably standing still.

957
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:06,834
Is there to be an official photograph?

958
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:10,880
Indeed, yes. In 38 minutes.

959
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:14,008
In which case, we might as well dance.

960
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:21,057
I've never done this before.

961
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:26,062
Just follow my lead.

962
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:41,494
- What do you see?
- Everything.

963
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:54,841
That is my curse.

964
01:40:56,259 --> 01:40:59,220
But you don't see
what you're looking for.

965
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:18,406
I thought you'd never ask.

966
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:22,994
Over my shoulder.

967
01:41:23,161 --> 01:41:26,873
Young man, German uniform,
ceremonial sword.

968
01:41:27,248 --> 01:41:28,583
Got him.

969
01:41:29,292 --> 01:41:31,294
Professional opinion?

970
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:34,005
Trauma.

971
01:41:34,172 --> 01:41:36,466
Major injury.

972
01:41:37,008 --> 01:41:39,135
But excellent repair work.

973
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:42,263
Dr. Hoffmanstahl.

974
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:45,767
<i>You did say he was
at the forefront of a medical innovation.</i>

975
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:48,519
<i>We've already seen an example
of his skills.</i>

976
01:41:50,647 --> 01:41:52,899
Those twins weren't twins.

977
01:41:53,066 --> 01:41:55,485
My suspicions were aroused in Heilbronn...

978
01:41:56,402 --> 01:41:59,030
<i>when one failed to go to
the aid of the other.</i>

979
01:41:59,197 --> 01:42:03,409
I also noticed the discreet
but unmistakable puckering behind the ear...

980
01:42:03,576 --> 01:42:06,663
where his skin had been drawn back.
I should've realized then...

981
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:09,707
that they were a surgical experiment.

982
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:13,211
To see if it is possible
to make one man look like another.

983
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:15,713
<i>His face is no longer his own.</i>

984
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:19,884
What better way to guarantee his world war
than to make the assassin--

985
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:23,388
One of the ambassadors.

986
01:42:25,682 --> 01:42:29,560
That narrows down the possibility
to one of six.

987
01:42:30,228 --> 01:42:33,231
You and Sim shall find her brother.

988
01:42:33,398 --> 01:42:35,566
- Of this I have no doubt.
- Holmes.

989
01:42:35,733 --> 01:42:37,819
You know my methods.

990
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:41,572
And I know where you'll be.

991
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:46,077
No possible solution could be
more congenial to me than this.

992
01:42:46,244 --> 01:42:49,580
By the way,
who taught you how to dance?

993
01:42:50,373 --> 01:42:51,708
You did.

994
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:55,128
Well, I've done a fine job.

995
01:42:56,462 --> 01:42:58,256
Be careful.

996
01:43:36,252 --> 01:43:37,336
Shall we go to work?

997
01:43:39,547 --> 01:43:43,968
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, gather for the portrait.

998
01:43:52,602 --> 01:43:54,353
I'm sorry.

999
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,773
Is this a bad time?

1000
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:59,150
Never better.

1001
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:01,362
Would you bring that clock?

1002
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:11,913
We get to play that game after all.

1003
01:44:25,051 --> 01:44:26,844
Here we are.

1004
01:44:32,517 --> 01:44:34,727
Don't want you to catch a cold.

1005
01:44:39,524 --> 01:44:40,983
A five-minute game?

1006
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:44,028
If you think you can manage it.

1007
01:45:05,007 --> 01:45:06,634
We both have two bishops.

1008
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:09,595
I may be absent from the room,
but my methods are not.

1009
01:45:10,054 --> 01:45:11,931
You can't mean Dr. Watson, surely.

1010
01:45:14,016 --> 01:45:15,351
That doesn't seem fair.

1011
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,944
Right. The surgery will have left scars.

1012
01:45:25,444 --> 01:45:28,072
Only four of them have the hairline
to hide them.

1013
01:45:32,410 --> 01:45:35,705
The ambassador that you replaced with Rene,
is he still alive?

1014
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:41,627
Would you like me to recommend
your next move?

1015
01:45:41,794 --> 01:45:45,506
They're all my brother's height,
right build...

1016
01:45:45,673 --> 01:45:47,466
but their eyes.

1017
01:45:47,633 --> 01:45:50,303
Their eyes are wrong.
Rene has blue eyes.

1018
01:45:52,847 --> 01:45:55,600
He could be wearing glass lenses
to change the color.

1019
01:45:56,934 --> 01:45:59,604
In which case, his eyes will be hurting.

1020
01:46:01,314 --> 01:46:03,774
Rene is left-handed.

1021
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:05,943
<i>Perhaps the assassin will take measures...</i>

1022
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:08,237
<i>to ensure he doesn't give himself away.</i>

1023
01:46:08,404 --> 01:46:09,947
Like a gambler concealing a tell.

1024
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:18,372
I think it might be him.

1025
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:20,791
You think?

1026
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,585
Your clock is ticking.

1027
01:46:22,752 --> 01:46:23,794
You have to be sure.

1028
01:46:23,961 --> 01:46:26,756
<i>May I remind you,
this is blitz chess.</i>

1029
01:46:26,923 --> 01:46:29,759
<i>A single miscalculation
will cost you the game.</i>

1030
01:46:31,886 --> 01:46:35,389
If I tackle the wrong man to the ground,
I could start a war.

1031
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:38,017
<i>Maybe it's less obvious.</i>

1032
01:46:38,184 --> 01:46:41,437
<i>A nervous tic.
A flutter of anxiety.</i>

1033
01:46:41,604 --> 01:46:44,482
I expect everyone has a reason
to be nervous tonight.

1034
01:46:50,112 --> 01:46:51,530
I don't know.

1035
01:46:58,788 --> 01:47:00,706
<i>So perhaps it's the opposite:</i>

1036
01:47:00,873 --> 01:47:03,042
<i>A failure to behave naturally.</i>

1037
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:06,504
<i>An actor so consumed
with his performance...</i>

1038
01:47:06,671 --> 01:47:09,757
<i>that the one characteristic
he cannot accommodate...</i>

1039
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:11,550
is spontaneous reaction.

1040
01:48:02,852 --> 01:48:05,146
Carruthers, protect the prime minister.

1041
01:48:13,779 --> 01:48:16,741
Germany will pay!
Mark my words!

1042
01:48:17,575 --> 01:48:19,243
That doesn't bode well, does it?

1043
01:48:21,245 --> 01:48:25,708
Seems your bishop
was of some benefit after all.

1044
01:48:26,208 --> 01:48:27,293
The game is still young.

1045
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:29,503
Actually, it's in its adolescence.

1046
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:35,634
There are more of us!

1047
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:40,723
Germany will pay!

1048
01:48:48,939 --> 01:48:51,358
No loose ends.

1049
01:48:56,572 --> 01:48:59,867
What happened to him?
I'm a doctor. A doctor!

1050
01:49:21,055 --> 01:49:22,973
What happened?

1051
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:24,767
- Curare.
- What's wrong with him?

1052
01:49:24,934 --> 01:49:26,143
It's poison.

1053
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:27,978
Do something!

1054
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:33,901
Doctor, do something!

1055
01:49:34,985 --> 01:49:36,320
No.

1056
01:49:52,002 --> 01:49:56,215
I think you've just lost
your most valuable piece.

1057
01:49:56,966 --> 01:50:01,011
But a winning strategy
sometimes necessitates sacrifice.

1058
01:50:01,178 --> 01:50:02,638
A war has been averted.

1059
01:50:02,805 --> 01:50:05,224
Mm. Oh, I disagree.

1060
01:50:05,808 --> 01:50:06,851
How so?

1061
01:50:07,685 --> 01:50:11,147
Didn't you find it strange
that the telegram you sent...

1062
01:50:11,313 --> 01:50:14,024
didn't inspire any action to stop me?

1063
01:50:17,111 --> 01:50:21,448
You see, hidden within the unconscious...

1064
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:24,201
is an insatiable desire for conflict.

1065
01:50:26,787 --> 01:50:32,835
So you're not fighting me so much
as you are the human condition.

1066
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:38,257
All I want to do is own the bullets
and the bandages.

1067
01:50:39,884 --> 01:50:43,637
War on an industrial scale is inevitable.

1068
01:50:43,804 --> 01:50:47,224
They'll do it themselves
within a few years.

1069
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:52,188
All I have to do is wait.

1070
01:50:56,901 --> 01:50:59,403
I like Switzerland.

1071
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:02,573
They respect a man's privacy here.

1072
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:05,743
Particularly if he has a fortune.

1073
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:15,294
Bishop takes knight. Check.

1074
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,922
The game is over.

1075
01:51:18,631 --> 01:51:20,799
You should get that shoulder looked at.

1076
01:51:20,966 --> 01:51:23,302
About that fortune of yours.

1077
01:51:23,469 --> 01:51:28,599
I believe it's just
been substantially reduced.

1078
01:51:29,225 --> 01:51:30,392
King to rook two.

1079
01:51:30,559 --> 01:51:32,436
I attended several of your lectures.

1080
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:35,356
The equations of motion,
which you will find in my book.

1081
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:38,525
The energy that is required
to release these explosions is--

1082
01:51:38,692 --> 01:51:42,488
<i>It was in Oslo when I first caught
a glimpse of your little notebook...</i>

1083
01:51:42,655 --> 01:51:45,032
red leather-bound from
Smythson of Bond Street.

1084
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:48,702
Rook to king's rook three. Check.

1085
01:51:57,670 --> 01:51:58,963
Bishop to rook three.

1086
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:01,674
Its importance was not
fully apparent to me...

1087
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,802
<i>until I observed your penchant
for feeding pigeons.</i>

1088
01:52:04,969 --> 01:52:08,889
Then it occurred
that with an empire so enormous...

1089
01:52:09,056 --> 01:52:12,309
even you must keep a record
of it somewhere.

1090
01:52:12,476 --> 01:52:13,852
Bishop takes bishop.

1091
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:16,105
Rook to bishop four.

1092
01:52:16,272 --> 01:52:19,108
I then only required the notebook itself.

1093
01:52:19,608 --> 01:52:20,693
<i>You didn't make it easy.</i>

1094
01:52:22,695 --> 01:52:24,029
Just the bags.

1095
01:52:24,196 --> 01:52:26,657
I would need to endure
a considerable amount of pain.

1096
01:52:28,993 --> 01:52:30,077
Mycroft...

1097
01:52:31,078 --> 01:52:34,873
care of Her Majesty's Secret Service.

1098
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:39,169
But the notebook would undoubtedly be encoded,
so how then to break the code?

1099
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:42,631
- Rook takes rook.
- Pawn takes rook.

1100
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:44,591
Bishop to bishop seven.

1101
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:46,719
Queen takes knight pawn.

1102
01:52:46,885 --> 01:52:52,266
Does <i>The Art of Domestic Horticulture</i>
mean anything to you?

1103
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:55,894
<i>How could a man as meticulous as you
own such a book...</i>

1104
01:52:56,061 --> 01:53:00,149
yet completely neglect the flowers
in his own window box? Irony abounds.

1105
01:53:06,071 --> 01:53:08,282
Never mind, it's safe, in London...

1106
01:53:09,992 --> 01:53:12,578
<i>where my colleagues are making
good use of it.</i>

1107
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:17,708
<i>The most formidable criminal mind in Europe
has just had all his money stolen...</i>

1108
01:53:17,875 --> 01:53:22,421
by perhaps the most inept inspector
in the history of Scotland Yard.

1109
01:53:22,588 --> 01:53:24,006
Any chance of a cup of tea?

1110
01:53:24,173 --> 01:53:26,842
Box 0403.

1111
01:53:27,259 --> 01:53:29,887
- Tick.
- Box 0801.

1112
01:53:30,054 --> 01:53:31,680
How much more is there?

1113
01:53:32,043 --> 01:53:34,212
That's the end of page two.

1114
01:53:34,378 --> 01:53:35,546
Page three.

1115
01:53:45,890 --> 01:53:51,062
He'll be making an anonymous donation
to the Widows and Orphans of War Fund.

1116
01:53:51,229 --> 01:53:54,607
Bishop to bishop eight.
Discover check.

1117
01:53:54,774 --> 01:53:57,401
And, incidentally, mate.

1118
01:54:01,989 --> 01:54:04,367
I seem to have injured my shoulder.
Would you mind?

1119
01:54:09,872 --> 01:54:11,833
Be my pleasure.

1120
01:54:14,752 --> 01:54:18,631
Once we've concluded our business here...

1121
01:54:18,798 --> 01:54:21,300
it's important you know...

1122
01:54:21,467 --> 01:54:25,680
I shall endeavor to find
the most creative of endings for the doctor.

1123
01:54:29,183 --> 01:54:30,351
And his wife.

1124
01:54:35,189 --> 01:54:37,066
<i>His advantage, my injury.</i>

1125
01:54:37,233 --> 01:54:40,236
<i>My advantage, his rage.</i>

1126
01:54:42,113 --> 01:54:46,492
<i>Incoming assault feral,
but experienced.</i>

1127
01:54:46,742 --> 01:54:49,579
<i>Use his momentum to counter.</i>

1128
01:54:55,209 --> 01:54:56,919
<i>Come now.</i>

1129
01:54:57,420 --> 01:55:01,716
<i>You really think you're the only one
who can play this game.</i>

1130
01:55:01,883 --> 01:55:05,428
<i>Trap arm. Target weakness.</i>

1131
01:55:05,887 --> 01:55:07,722
<i>Follow with haymaker.</i>

1132
01:55:07,889 --> 01:55:10,850
<i>Ah. There we find
the boxing champion of Cambridge.</i>

1133
01:55:11,017 --> 01:55:13,394
<i>Competent, but predictable.</i>

1134
01:55:15,730 --> 01:55:18,608
<i>Now allow me to reply.</i>

1135
01:55:20,109 --> 01:55:23,446
<i>Arsenal running dry.
Adjust strategy.</i>

1136
01:55:27,575 --> 01:55:29,744
<i>Wound taking its toll.</i>

1137
01:55:29,911 --> 01:55:34,373
<i>As I feared.
Injury makes defense untenable.</i>

1138
01:55:39,462 --> 01:55:43,466
<i>Prognosis increasingly negative.</i>

1139
01:55:47,428 --> 01:55:50,973
<i>Let's not waste any more
of one another's time.</i>

1140
01:55:55,853 --> 01:55:58,773
<i>We both know how this ends.</i>

1141
01:56:12,745 --> 01:56:14,956
<i>Conclusion, inevitable.</i>

1142
01:56:17,708 --> 01:56:18,751
<i>Unless...</i>

1143
01:57:27,820 --> 01:57:32,033
<i>A few words may suffice
to tell the little that remains.</i>

1144
01:57:39,206 --> 01:57:44,545
<i>Any attempt at finding the bodies
was absolutely hopeless.</i>

1145
01:57:48,716 --> 01:57:50,843
<i>And so there...</i>

1146
01:57:51,010 --> 01:57:56,932
<i>deep down in that dreadful caldron
of swirling water and seething foam...</i>

1147
01:58:02,396 --> 01:58:03,647
<i>will lie for all time...</i>

1148
01:58:06,776 --> 01:58:09,236
<i>the most dangerous criminal...</i>

1149
01:58:11,238 --> 01:58:15,576
<i>and the foremost champion of the law
of their generation.</i>

1150
01:58:20,706 --> 01:58:23,959
<i>I shall ever regard him as the best...</i>

1151
01:58:28,881 --> 01:58:32,927
<i>and the wisest man
whom I have ever known.</i>

1152
01:58:33,093 --> 01:58:34,762
John?

1153
01:58:37,306 --> 01:58:39,475
- John.
- Mm-hm.

1154
01:58:40,142 --> 01:58:41,769
You should probably pack.

1155
01:58:41,936 --> 01:58:42,978
It's half past 2...

1156
01:58:43,145 --> 01:58:45,064
- and the carriage is coming at 4.
- Mm.

1157
01:58:46,398 --> 01:58:48,818
It's gonna be a beautiful week in Brighton.

1158
01:58:49,652 --> 01:58:51,487
Yes, it'll be fun.

1159
01:58:52,029 --> 01:58:53,447
I'm looking forward to it.

1160
01:58:55,616 --> 01:58:57,409
You know I miss him too...

1161
01:58:58,118 --> 01:58:59,787
in my own way.

1162
01:59:06,961 --> 01:59:08,420
He would have wanted us to go.

1163
01:59:10,089 --> 01:59:12,925
He would have wanted to come with us.

1164
01:59:14,426 --> 01:59:16,762
When's Mrs. Hudson coming for Gladstone?

1165
01:59:16,929 --> 01:59:19,139
Oh, soon.

1166
01:59:21,225 --> 01:59:22,852
Three o'clock.

1167
01:59:49,086 --> 01:59:50,546
Mary?

1168
01:59:52,172 --> 01:59:54,258
Who delivered this parcel?

1169
01:59:54,425 --> 01:59:56,385
The postman.

1170
01:59:57,803 --> 02:00:00,097
The usual chap or--

1171
02:00:00,264 --> 02:00:03,309
did he look peculiar?

1172
02:08:40,409 --> 02:08:42,411
