1
00:00:33,115 -->  00:00:36,451
<i>The year was 1891.</i>

2
00:00:36,618 -->  00:00:39,037
<i>Storm clouds were brewing over Europe.</i>

3
00:00:40,622 -->  00:00:43,917
<i>France and Germany
were at each other's throats...</i>

4
00:00:44,084 -->  00:00:47,045
<i>the result of a series of bombings.</i>

5
00:00:48,714 -->  00:00:51,216
<i>Some said it was Nationalists...</i>

6
00:00:51,717 -->  00:00:53,885
<i>others, the anarchists.</i>

7
00:00:54,052 -->  00:00:56,054
<i>But as usual...</i>

8
00:00:56,555 -->  00:00:59,933
<i>my friend Sherlock Holmes</i>

9
00:01:00,100 -->  00:01:02,185
<i>had a different theory entirely.</i>

10
00:01:09,109 -->  00:01:12,112
<i>Bombing in Strasbourg!
Read all about it!</i>

11
00:01:13,071 -->  00:01:14,948
- Thank you.
- Anarchists suspected...

12
00:01:15,115 -->  00:01:17,576
in Strasbourg bombing!

13
00:01:27,335 -->  00:01:29,921
Bombing in Strasbourg!

14
00:02:03,789 -->  00:02:06,792
When did you start working
for the postal service?

15
00:02:08,543 -->  00:02:09,961
That was you back there.

16
00:02:10,128 -->  00:02:12,756
Shame your activities
have landed you in the gutter.

17
00:02:12,923 -->  00:02:16,051
A curious parcel.
Who's the intended recipient?

18
00:02:16,218 -->  00:02:18,303
Why don't we discuss that
over dinner tonight?

19
00:02:18,470 -->  00:02:20,514
- I'm free for lunch.
- Hmm. I'm not.

20
00:02:20,680 -->  00:02:23,183
How about the Savoy, 8:00?

21
00:02:23,350 -->  00:02:24,392
- Splendid.
- Hmm.

22
00:02:24,559 -->  00:02:26,311
And will you be coming as yourself?

23
00:02:26,478 -->  00:02:28,688
Most likely.

24
00:02:29,439 -->  00:02:32,150
Three men have been following you
for the last half mile...

25
00:02:32,317 -->  00:02:34,277
their motives highly unsavory.

26
00:02:37,072 -->  00:02:38,573
No.

27
00:02:46,748 -->  00:02:50,502
Oh, and, by the way, they're not pursuing me,
they're escorting me.

28
00:02:50,669 -->  00:02:54,631
And instead of three,
there seems to be, uh, four.

29
00:02:57,634 -->  00:02:59,135
Steady hands with that, Irene.

30
00:02:59,302 -->  00:03:02,347
Oh, I don't think it's my hands
you have to worry about.

31
00:03:02,514 -->  00:03:05,517
Be careful with the face, boys.
We do have a dinner date tonight.

32
00:03:06,017 -->  00:03:07,060
Don't fill up on bread.

33
00:03:32,627 -->  00:03:33,879
I forgot the rest.

34
00:03:38,049 -->  00:03:39,259
Oh, it's coming back now.

35
00:04:09,247 -->  00:04:10,415
Peelers!

36
00:05:18,441 -->  00:05:22,487
We now come to Lot 34...

37
00:05:22,654 -->  00:05:27,492
Egyptian sarcophagus
of outstanding provenance...

38
00:05:27,659 -->  00:05:29,661
retrieved from the Valley of the Kings.

39
00:05:29,828 -->  00:05:32,038
Your payment, doctor.
He sends his thanks.

40
00:05:32,205 -->  00:05:33,331
Who will bid...

41
00:05:33,665 -->  00:05:34,791
100 pounds?

42
00:05:35,333 -->  00:05:37,085
One hundred. Thank you, sir.

43
00:05:38,920 -->  00:05:41,673
Please, give this to him.
He's expecting it.

44
00:05:42,215 -->  00:05:45,635
Tell him our friend thinks
I delivered it to his sister.

45
00:05:50,932 -->  00:05:53,184
Uh-- Stay...

46
00:05:53,351 -->  00:05:55,186
while I check the contents.

47
00:05:56,396 -->  00:05:58,815
I was assured full payment
would be there.

48
00:05:58,982 -->  00:06:01,776
Yes, but assured by whom?

49
00:06:02,193 -->  00:06:03,695
Have you ever met him in person?

50
00:06:05,363 -->  00:06:07,240
Or like me, have you been--?

51
00:06:08,158 -->  00:06:10,326
Hold it, hold it.
Please, don't move it.

52
00:06:10,869 -->  00:06:14,164
Judging from size and weight,
it's not the payment you were expecting.

53
00:06:14,914 -->  00:06:17,292
I'd wager the contents
are rather more incendiary.

54
00:06:17,459 -->  00:06:19,794
- Who is this?
- It's--

55
00:06:19,961 -->  00:06:21,004
Hello, darling.

56
00:06:26,509 -->  00:06:30,555
Oh, dear. I told you not to move it.
It seems a secondary charge has been activated.

57
00:06:30,722 -->  00:06:33,767
Sweet thing, I might need your help
in the disposal of this parcel.

58
00:06:33,933 -->  00:06:38,688
One thousand six hundred, 1700, 1800.

59
00:06:38,855 -->  00:06:40,815
- Well, good luck.
- One million pounds.

60
00:06:43,610 -->  00:06:46,029
Oh, and by the way, fire.

61
00:06:46,196 -->  00:06:47,405
Fire!

62
00:06:53,119 -->  00:06:54,996
Leave my side,
you'll be dead in an hour.

63
00:06:55,163 -->  00:06:56,706
And don't be late for dinner.

64
00:06:56,873 -->  00:07:00,001
My schedule will be quite tight
because of these activities here.

65
00:07:00,168 -->  00:07:03,922
- I've never been late in my life, only early.
- Fashionably.

66
00:07:06,091 -->  00:07:08,843
Very witty.
So confident, even in retreat.

67
00:07:09,010 -->  00:07:12,138
I'll hold onto that.
We'll read it together over an aperitif.

68
00:07:12,305 -->  00:07:15,809
Fine. Dinner and a show.

69
00:07:19,771 -->  00:07:22,607
Stay. Trust me.
This is what I do for a living.

70
00:07:24,484 -->  00:07:27,278
Herr Hoffmanstahl,
you should count yourself lucky.

71
00:07:27,779 -->  00:07:32,117
This faceless man with whom you find yourself
in business is no ordinary criminal.

72
00:07:32,283 -->  00:07:36,913
He's the Napoleon of crime.
Fortunately, you now have me as an ally.

73
00:07:37,080 -->  00:07:40,333
I'm a consulting detective of some repute.

74
00:07:40,500 -->  00:07:43,211
Perhaps you've heard of me?
My name is Sherlock--

75
00:07:46,131 -->  00:07:47,132
Holmes.

76
00:08:32,343 -->  00:08:34,804
A fresh pot of tea.
Thank you, George.

77
00:08:34,971 -->  00:08:36,764
Yes, Miss Adler.

78
00:08:38,516 -->  00:08:41,227
Fine choice, this place.

79
00:08:42,896 -->  00:08:44,439
Do you have the letter?

80
00:08:45,523 -->  00:08:46,608
It was taken.

81
00:08:47,442 -->  00:08:50,612
Taken? Now, that is unfortunate.

82
00:08:53,531 -->  00:08:56,701
During the chaos created
by your package.

83
00:08:56,868 -->  00:08:57,869
Thank you.

84
00:09:00,496 -->  00:09:04,542
Perhaps if you had shared your plans.

85
00:09:05,043 -->  00:09:07,962
You wish to know my plans now, do you?

86
00:09:08,129 -->  00:09:11,591
Did you imagine, Miss Adler,
that something would happen to you?

87
00:09:11,758 -->  00:09:14,636
Is that why you chose to meet here
in a public place?

88
00:09:14,802 -->  00:09:16,054
Your favorite restaurant?

89
00:09:48,253 -->  00:09:50,463
I don't blame you.

90
00:09:51,839 -->  00:09:54,133
I blame myself.

91
00:09:54,842 -->  00:10:00,056
It's been apparent to me for some time that
you had succumbed to your feelings for him.

92
00:10:01,557 -->  00:10:06,896
And this isn't the first occasion Mr. Holmes
has inconvenienced me in recent months.

93
00:10:07,689 -->  00:10:09,607
The question is...

94
00:10:10,525 -->  00:10:13,236
what to do about it.

95
00:10:18,283 -->  00:10:23,037
But that's my problem to solve now.

96
00:10:26,833 -->  00:10:29,294
I no longer require your services.

97
00:11:59,217 -->  00:12:00,968
Mrs. Hudson?

98
00:12:02,387 -->  00:12:04,889
Oh, Mrs. Hudson?

99
00:12:07,392 -->  00:12:09,602
Holmes, you in there?

100
00:12:17,402 -->  00:12:19,612
Your hedge needs trimming.

101
00:12:22,240 -->  00:12:24,700
Where am I?

102
00:12:24,867 -->  00:12:27,745
I don't care where you are
as long as you're ready.

103
00:12:31,624 -->  00:12:33,793
I'm waiting.

104
00:12:37,755 -->  00:12:39,173
I'm not gonna play this game.

105
00:12:40,258 -->  00:12:43,594
Remember, I have to catch the last--

106
00:12:47,849 -->  00:12:48,642
train.

107
00:12:49,809 -->  00:12:52,812
- That's you dead, I'm afraid.
- You win.

108
00:12:54,814 -->  00:12:58,693
I lose. Game over.

109
00:13:00,278 -->  00:13:02,572
Still don't see me?

110
00:13:12,290 -->  00:13:14,459
I'm not going out with you
dressed like that.

111
00:13:16,294 -->  00:13:18,838
Would you prefer I joined you
in the fashion faux pas...

112
00:13:19,005 -->  00:13:22,216
of wearing fine military dress
with that heinous handmade scarf...

113
00:13:22,383 -->  00:13:24,760
clearly one of your fiancée's
early efforts?

114
00:13:25,470 -->  00:13:27,096
Oh, how I've missed you, Holmes.

115
00:13:27,263 -->  00:13:29,849
Have you? Why?

116
00:13:30,475 -->  00:13:33,895
I've barely noticed your absence.
Then again, I'm knee-deep in research.

117
00:13:34,061 -->  00:13:36,898
Extracting fluids from the
adrenal glands of sheep...

118
00:13:37,064 -->  00:13:39,775
and designing my own urban camouflage...

119
00:13:39,942 -->  00:13:42,487
all the while verging
on a decisive breakthrough...

120
00:13:42,653 -->  00:13:46,991
in the single most important case
of my career, perhaps of all time.

121
00:13:49,160 -->  00:13:50,369
Mrs. Hudson, how are you?

122
00:13:50,536 -->  00:13:54,499
Oh. I'm so pleased to see you, doctor.
Thank you for inviting me tomorrow.

123
00:13:54,665 -->  00:13:57,293
And thank you for looking after Gladstone.

124
00:13:57,460 -->  00:14:03,424
Dear, dear sickly-sweet Nanny,
might I have a word?

125
00:14:04,759 -->  00:14:08,137
Yummy. Feed the snake, woman.

126
00:14:08,471 -->  00:14:10,389
You feed it.

127
00:14:11,349 -->  00:14:14,018
Touchy, touchy.

128
00:14:15,311 -->  00:14:17,688
Doctor, you must get him to a sanatorium.

129
00:14:17,939 -->  00:14:20,983
He's been on a diet of coffee, tobacco,
and coca leaves.

130
00:14:21,442 -->  00:14:25,279
He never sleeps. I hear multiple voices
as if he's rehearsing a play.

131
00:14:26,907 -->  00:14:31,285
- Leave him to me.
- Don't you have a goat that needs worming?

132
00:14:31,452 -->  00:14:33,913
Oh, how kind of you to remind me.

133
00:14:34,080 -->  00:14:38,084
So much to look forward to.
What would I do without you?

134
00:14:39,168 -->  00:14:41,254
Good luck with your patient, doctor.

135
00:14:42,380 -->  00:14:43,548
Why are you here?

136
00:14:44,757 -->  00:14:46,759
I'm getting married tomorrow.

137
00:14:48,177 -->  00:14:50,012
Oh! Embrace me.

138
00:14:51,222 -->  00:14:53,099
Watson's getting married.

139
00:14:53,266 -->  00:14:56,644
- You've lost a few pounds, Holmes.
- Yes, and you've picked them up.

140
00:14:56,811 -->  00:14:58,855
Noshing on Mary's muffins, no doubt.

141
00:15:00,022 -->  00:15:02,900
Pour us a brandy.
The stag party has begun.

142
00:15:04,318 -->  00:15:07,238
It is our last adventure, Watson.

143
00:15:07,405 -->  00:15:09,448
I intend to make the most of it.

144
00:15:21,085 -->  00:15:23,337
I see you've made good use
of my old office.

145
00:15:23,504 -->  00:15:26,257
- Do you like my spider's web?
- Is that what you call it?

146
00:15:26,757 -->  00:15:28,175
Follow that strand.

147
00:15:29,594 -->  00:15:33,931
Question: What do a scandal involving
an Indian cotton tycoon...

148
00:15:34,098 -->  00:15:36,183
the overdose of a Chinese opium trader...

149
00:15:36,350 -->  00:15:38,352
bombings in Strasbourg and Vienna...

150
00:15:38,519 -->  00:15:41,981
and the death of a steel magnate in America
all have in common?

151
00:15:43,941 -->  00:15:49,614
Well, according to your diorama,
Professor James Moriarty.

152
00:15:49,780 -->  00:15:50,781
Indeed.

153
00:15:51,657 -->  00:15:56,037
Mathematical genius.
Celebrated author and lecturer.

154
00:15:56,203 -->  00:15:57,788
Boxing champion at Cambridge...

155
00:15:57,955 -->  00:16:00,916
where he made friends
with our current prime minister.

156
00:16:01,083 -->  00:16:03,794
Do you have any evidence
to substantiate your claim?

157
00:16:07,548 -->  00:16:09,884
This. Now do you see?

158
00:16:11,969 -->  00:16:14,263
- Dr. Hoffmanstahl's death?
- Yes.

159
00:16:14,430 -->  00:16:16,766
I've heard you speak of him,
extolling his virtues.

160
00:16:16,932 -->  00:16:20,728
Hoffmanstahl was at the forefront
of medical innovations, a true pioneer.

161
00:16:20,895 -->  00:16:24,398
Just the other day, I averted an explosion
that was intended for him.

162
00:16:25,608 -->  00:16:27,693
Says here he died of a heart attack.

163
00:16:27,902 -->  00:16:32,281
Has all my instruction been for naught?
You still read the official statement and believe it.

164
00:16:32,448 -->  00:16:34,825
It's a game, dear man, a shadowy game.

165
00:16:34,992 -->  00:16:38,871
We're playing oat and mouse,
the professor and I. Cloak and dagger.

166
00:16:39,497 -->  00:16:41,040
I thought it was spider and fly?

167
00:16:42,458 -->  00:16:44,251
I'm not a fly, I'm a cat.

168
00:16:44,418 -->  00:16:46,670
Not a mouse, but a dagger.

169
00:16:46,837 -->  00:16:48,339
You're drinking embalming fluid.

170
00:16:49,173 -->  00:16:52,176
Oh. Yes. Care for a drop?

171
00:16:52,593 -->  00:16:53,636
You do seem--

172
00:16:53,803 -->  00:16:54,845
- Excited?
- Manic.

173
00:16:55,012 -->  00:16:56,013
- I am.
- Verging on--

174
00:16:56,180 -->  00:16:57,640
- Ecstatic?
- Psychotic.

175
00:16:59,433 -->  00:17:02,561
- Should've brought a sedative.
- I'll give my life to see his demise.

176
00:17:02,728 -->  00:17:07,024
He must be stopped before
his evil machinations come to a crescendo.

177
00:17:07,191 -->  00:17:08,484
And how will he do all this?

178
00:17:08,651 -->  00:17:12,446
Don't be a dingy bird.
Bad people do bad things because they can.

179
00:17:12,613 -->  00:17:16,700
No one, not the victims, the police,
the governments, not anyone--

180
00:17:16,867 -->  00:17:19,495
- Except the great Sherlock Holmes...
- Correct.

181
00:17:19,662 -->  00:17:21,997
- on this diet, will work it all out.
- Right.

182
00:17:22,164 -->  00:17:24,917
- Or thereabouts.
- Thereabouts, not quite there.

183
00:17:25,334 -->  00:17:27,211
Here's to your good health.

184
00:17:28,504 -->  00:17:30,172
Dingy bird.

185
00:17:34,218 -->  00:17:36,762
What have you done to Gladstone now?

186
00:17:36,929 -->  00:17:40,808
<i>Ricinus communis.</i>
The fruit is highly toxic.

187
00:17:40,975 -->  00:17:42,393
He's barely breathing.

188
00:17:43,018 -->  00:17:45,479
What an excellent opportunity.

189
00:17:45,646 -->  00:17:46,814
This may be just the thing.

190
00:17:48,190 -->  00:17:51,444
Sorry, do you mind terribly
if I try my adrenal extract?

191
00:17:51,610 -->  00:17:54,071
How many times are you going
to kill my dog, Holmes?

192
00:17:57,074 -->  00:17:58,993
Took off like a monkey from a box.

193
00:17:59,160 -->  00:18:01,787
- Hmm.
- I may need one of those in a few hours.

194
00:18:01,954 -->  00:18:03,539
Consider it a wedding gift.

195
00:18:05,124 -->  00:18:08,043
Watson, might we use an alternative exit?

196
00:18:09,170 -->  00:18:11,547
Is there something different about you?

197
00:18:11,755 -->  00:18:13,757
I'm under observation.

198
00:18:14,508 -->  00:18:15,801
As you should be.

199
00:18:15,968 -->  00:18:17,344
You drive.

200
00:18:20,681 -->  00:18:24,351
Will your beard be with us all night?

201
00:18:24,518 -->  00:18:28,022
I'll remove it once
we're south of Trafalgar Square.

202
00:18:29,148 -->  00:18:31,775
If you believe Moriarty
has you under observation...

203
00:18:31,942 -->  00:18:33,652
isn't this a bit conspicuous?

204
00:18:33,819 -->  00:18:37,114
It's so overt, it's covert.

205
00:18:40,784 -->  00:18:44,121
Trafalgar Square.
You must be safe by now.

206
00:18:51,629 -->  00:18:54,381
Why are you looking at me
with such concern?

207
00:18:54,548 -->  00:18:59,178
I'm so very worried.
Your vitality's been drained from you.

208
00:18:59,512 -->  00:19:03,098
- Marriage is the end, I tell you.
- I think of it as the beginning.

209
00:19:03,265 -->  00:19:04,558
- Armageddon.
- Rebirth.

210
00:19:04,725 -->  00:19:06,227
- Restriction.
- Structure.

211
00:19:06,393 -->  00:19:09,063
- Answering to a woman.
- Being in a relationship.

212
00:19:09,730 -->  00:19:13,567
A life in matrimony,
the possibility of a family.

213
00:19:13,734 -->  00:19:15,361
Who wants to die alone?

214
00:19:16,445 -->  00:19:18,572
We'll have a good old-fashioned romp tonight...

215
00:19:18,739 -->  00:19:22,243
you'll settle down, have a family,
and I'll die alone.

216
00:19:22,701 -->  00:19:24,745
Yes, that's about it.

217
00:19:26,705 -->  00:19:32,294
Perhaps it's better for one to die alone
than to live life in eternal purgatory.

218
00:19:35,506 -->  00:19:37,174
Anyway...

219
00:19:41,845 -->  00:19:43,514
Not bad, that.

220
00:19:43,681 -->  00:19:45,516
So where are we going?

221
00:19:45,683 -->  00:19:49,270
In the future, there'll be one of those machines
in every town in Europe.

222
00:19:49,436 -->  00:19:51,981
Loitering in the woodshed again,
are we, Myccie?

223
00:19:52,147 -->  00:19:54,358
- Good evening, Sherly.
- Well.

224
00:19:54,525 -->  00:19:57,194
I see your bootmaker is ill, dear brother.

225
00:19:57,361 -->  00:20:01,490
As I detect that you've recently changed
the brand of soap with which you shave.

226
00:20:01,657 -->  00:20:03,867
The chimney in the front room
at Baker Street...

227
00:20:04,034 -->  00:20:05,869
still needs a damn good sweeping up.

228
00:20:06,036 -->  00:20:09,873
Were you aware that the hackney carriage
by which you arrived had a damaged wheel?

229
00:20:10,040 -->  00:20:12,793
Yes, the left. And it's plain
to the meanest intelligence...

230
00:20:12,960 -->  00:20:16,380
that you have recently acquired
a new bow for your violin.

231
00:20:16,547 -->  00:20:18,257
Same bow, new strings.

232
00:20:18,424 -->  00:20:21,802
And may I deduce, Mycroft--?
Good evening, by the way.

233
00:20:21,969 -->  00:20:23,220
No.

234
00:20:24,221 -->  00:20:26,265
- He doesn't.
- May I deduce that you...

235
00:20:26,432 -->  00:20:31,604
who rarely strays from the path
that runs from your home to the Diogenes Club...

236
00:20:31,770 -->  00:20:35,357
and never on a Monday when they serve
your favorite potted shrimps...

237
00:20:35,524 -->  00:20:40,487
must be here for some
far more important reason than my stag party?

238
00:20:41,405 -->  00:20:46,577
You know, he's nothing like as slow-witted
as you'd been leading me to believe, Sherly.

239
00:20:46,744 -->  00:20:48,454
No, you're quite right, Dr. Watson...

240
00:20:48,621 -->  00:20:53,792
but with all the conflict in Europe
at the moment, the whole situation could--

241
00:20:53,959 -->  00:20:56,128
Excuse me... suddenly erupt.

242
00:20:56,295 -->  00:21:00,215
I am here to avoid a dire catastrophe.

243
00:21:00,382 -->  00:21:04,053
If the concerns of two nations...

244
00:21:04,219 -->  00:21:06,180
which shall remain nameless...

245
00:21:06,347 -->  00:21:10,726
but I can tell you they speak
French and German...

246
00:21:10,893 -->  00:21:14,396
are not dealt with tonight,
I shall be forced to go to Switzerland...

247
00:21:14,563 -->  00:21:17,941
to attend the ghastly peace summit
in Reichenbach.

248
00:21:18,108 -->  00:21:20,444
The worst thing about Switzerland
is the altitude.

249
00:21:20,611 -->  00:21:22,863
It gives me nosebleeds,
exacerbates my asthma--

250
00:21:23,030 -->  00:21:26,325
I'm so glad you invited your brother.

251
00:21:41,840 -->  00:21:42,883
This looks promising.

252
00:21:43,258 -->  00:21:45,344
And your poison of choice, gentlemen?

253
00:21:45,511 -->  00:21:48,180
We'll start with the champagne.
We may need several more chairs.

254
00:21:48,347 -->  00:21:50,349
Perhaps a good cigar.

255
00:21:51,100 -->  00:21:54,144
And don't bother with the chairs.

256
00:21:55,229 -->  00:21:56,980
What is it your brother does exactly?

257
00:21:57,147 -->  00:21:59,942
He's the keeper
of the broom cupboard of state.

258
00:22:00,109 -->  00:22:01,819
No ambition, no energy...

259
00:22:01,985 -->  00:22:05,781
yet I'm repeatedly told that he's
indispensable to the British government...

260
00:22:05,948 -->  00:22:07,574
particularly the Foreign Office.

261
00:22:07,741 -->  00:22:10,452
- I would like to propose a toast.
- Really?

262
00:22:10,619 -->  00:22:13,497
To my dear friend, Dr. John--

263
00:22:14,498 -->  00:22:18,210
um, Hamish Watson...

264
00:22:18,377 -->  00:22:19,420
I'm right here.

265
00:22:19,586 -->  00:22:23,173
on the eve of his wedding. He--

266
00:22:25,217 -->  00:22:26,719
has been the best companion.

267
00:22:26,885 -->  00:22:29,596
Shouldn't we be waiting
for the boys from my rugby club?

268
00:22:29,763 -->  00:22:32,182
He has always kept us--
They couldn't attend.

269
00:22:32,349 -->  00:22:34,309
flat-footed on the ground.

270
00:22:34,476 -->  00:22:36,562
All of them? Hmm.
The chaps from my medical school?

271
00:22:36,729 -->  00:22:38,814
- They declined.
- The lads from the regiment?

272
00:22:38,981 -->  00:22:42,693
- No man's better worth having at your side--
- Who is it you're looking for?

273
00:22:42,860 -->  00:22:45,446
Because I don't know
a single damn person here, do I?

274
00:22:45,612 -->  00:22:48,157
There's no need for hysterics.
You know me and Mycroft.

275
00:22:48,323 -->  00:22:51,493
- Don't be a ponce, Watson.
- Ponce?

276
00:22:52,411 -->  00:22:55,831
You completely forgot about my stag party,
didn't you?

277
00:22:58,000 -->  00:23:00,669
- Why are we here?
- Your very good health, doctor.

278
00:23:00,836 -->  00:23:02,963
Shame none of your friends
could make it.

279
00:23:09,803 -->  00:23:13,474
I'm going to the gaming tables.
I refuse for this night to be a total loss.

280
00:23:13,640 -->  00:23:16,810
- Give me my money.
- Happily. Give me the wedding ring.

281
00:23:16,977 -->  00:23:19,980
So now you're interested
in being the best man.

282
00:23:20,147 -->  00:23:22,566
You're supposed to keep the ring anyway.

283
00:23:22,733 -->  00:23:25,360
Just as you're supposed
to organize my stag party.

284
00:23:25,527 -->  00:23:28,197
- Don't want to lose it on a bet.
- And invite my friends...

285
00:23:28,363 -->  00:23:32,034
of which, by the way, there are many.
You're the one with no friends...

286
00:23:32,201 -->  00:23:34,536
Sherly No Mates.

287
00:23:38,665 -->  00:23:41,335
He's all "me, me, me," isn't he?

288
00:23:51,845 -->  00:23:53,055
I win!

289
00:24:03,899 -->  00:24:05,818
Please, sit.

290
00:24:05,984 -->  00:24:08,737
Put your money on the table
and we will begin.

291
00:24:14,535 -->  00:24:17,371
Welcome. I am Madam Simza.

292
00:24:21,667 -->  00:24:25,504
Cards can illuminate your past...

293
00:24:25,963 -->  00:24:29,091
clarify your present,
and show you the future.

294
00:24:31,468 -->  00:24:35,138
If you have a specific question,
hold it in your mind.

295
00:24:43,355 -->  00:24:45,732
I'm holding.

296
00:24:47,025 -->  00:24:48,652
Let me know when you're ready.

297
00:24:49,194 -->  00:24:51,321
Actually, I'd prefer to read...

298
00:24:51,864 -->  00:24:52,906
your fortune.

299
00:24:57,536 -->  00:24:59,872
Temperance inverted.

300
00:25:00,914 -->  00:25:02,249
Indicative of volatility.

301
00:25:03,250 -->  00:25:06,336
A woman who has recently
taken her comfort in drink.

302
00:25:06,503 -->  00:25:09,882
From what does she seek solace?
What does she not wish to see?

303
00:25:11,508 -->  00:25:13,969
- A fool embarrassing himself?
- Hmm.

304
00:25:14,136 -->  00:25:17,514
- Hmm.
- Oh, yes. The Fool.

305
00:25:17,681 -->  00:25:21,518
Someone has been led astray,
involved in something without their knowledge.

306
00:25:21,685 -->  00:25:25,397
Not bad, but you have
to make me believe you.

307
00:25:25,564 -->  00:25:26,982
I have to see it in your eyes.

308
00:25:27,149 -->  00:25:29,860
- Right. I can do better.
- Uh-huh.

309
00:25:30,444 -->  00:25:33,030
The Two of Cups, a powerful bond.

310
00:25:33,196 -->  00:25:36,283
But between whom?
A brother and sister perhaps?

311
00:25:37,826 -->  00:25:40,662
And I see a name. Yes, it's...

312
00:25:40,954 -->  00:25:42,664
Rene.

313
00:25:44,583 -->  00:25:45,834
What do you want?

314
00:25:46,376 -->  00:25:47,377
The Devil.

315
00:25:52,716 -->  00:25:54,092
Why are we playing this game?

316
00:26:03,977 -->  00:26:05,062
Where did you get this?

317
00:26:05,228 -->  00:26:09,483
I stole it from a woman in an auction room,
but I believe it was intended for you.

318
00:26:25,457 -->  00:26:26,833
"Found my purpose in life."

319
00:26:27,000 -->  00:26:31,296
So the question I've been holding is,
what purpose is Rene fulfilling?

320
00:26:35,258 -->  00:26:36,802
Time is up.

321
00:26:37,427 -->  00:26:39,596
I have other clients.

322
00:26:45,018 -->  00:26:47,980
Though you may not have detected
the wisp of astrakhan fur...

323
00:26:48,146 -->  00:26:50,232
snagged on a nail
over my left shoulder...

324
00:26:50,399 -->  00:26:53,276
you couldn't have failed to notice
the overpowering aroma...

325
00:26:53,443 -->  00:26:55,404
of herring pickled in vodka...

326
00:26:55,570 -->  00:26:58,448
in tandem with a truly unfortunate body odor.

327
00:26:58,615 -->  00:27:01,827
There's a man concealed
in the rafters above us.

328
00:27:01,994 -->  00:27:05,622
A Cossack, renowned for
their infeasible acrobatic abilities...

329
00:27:05,789 -->  00:27:09,251
and are notorious for moonlighting
as assassins.

330
00:27:09,418 -->  00:27:13,630
So it's safe to presume
that your next client is here to kill you.

331
00:27:13,797 -->  00:27:16,425
Anything else? No?

332
00:27:22,973 -->  00:27:25,684
<i>First, pillage the nest.</i>

333
00:27:28,770 -->  00:27:30,147
<i>Clip wings.</i>

334
00:27:32,399 -->  00:27:34,818
<i>Now blunt his beak.</i>

335
00:27:39,489 -->  00:27:41,116
<i>Crack eggs.</i>

336
00:27:42,701 -->  00:27:45,537
<i>Scramble. Pinch of salt.</i>

337
00:27:48,081 -->  00:27:49,583
<i>Touch of pepper.</i>

338
00:27:55,172 -->  00:27:56,548
<i>Flip the omelet.</i>

339
00:28:01,136 -->  00:28:03,305
<i>Additional seasoning required.</i>

340
00:28:05,140 -->  00:28:07,809
<i>Breakfast is served.</i>

341
00:28:21,239 -->  00:28:25,077
Come with me.
I need you alive. Now.

342
00:28:27,829 -->  00:28:29,164
Oh!

343
00:29:36,439 -->  00:29:38,400
Didn't see that in the cards, did you?

344
00:29:42,028 -->  00:29:43,613
Oh...

345
00:29:58,545 -->  00:30:00,297
Coming down, folks, coming down.

346
00:30:00,463 -->  00:30:03,258
Looks like we've got ourselves
our next cockfight.

347
00:30:05,093 -->  00:30:09,681
Five, four, three, two, one...

348
00:30:09,848 -->  00:30:11,349
let him go!

349
00:30:37,000 -->  00:30:38,919
Get up there!

350
00:30:48,595 -->  00:30:49,804
All mine?

351
00:31:14,704 -->  00:31:16,456
Now, wait a minute.

352
00:31:48,863 -->  00:31:51,032
You're right. He did stink.

353
00:31:51,199 -->  00:31:53,034
Hey, you can run--

354
00:31:53,201 -->  00:31:55,287
Where's you?

355
00:31:57,872 -->  00:31:59,749
Just had a fight.

356
00:32:01,918 -->  00:32:03,378
- Just had a fight.
- Yes.

357
00:32:03,545 -->  00:32:05,171
- Where were you?
- I'm glad to see...

358
00:32:05,338 -->  00:32:07,924
you're taking your best-man duties
so seriously.

359
00:32:08,091 -->  00:32:11,761
I was on my own!
Not gonna get my monies!

360
00:32:11,928 -->  00:32:13,346
She was biting my leg.

361
00:32:13,513 -->  00:32:17,058
I'll have Carruthers put some fuel
into that motor carriage of yours.

362
00:32:17,225 -->  00:32:18,893
You do have a wedding to attend.

363
00:32:19,227 -->  00:32:20,270
Oh, I'll drive.

364
00:32:20,437 -->  00:32:21,730
Hmm.

365
00:32:24,482 -->  00:32:25,192
Ho-honk. 

366
00:32:26,359 -->  00:32:29,988
- Let's have another drink.
- No, no, I think you've had quite enough.

367
00:34:29,232 -->  00:34:31,526
Present arms!

368
00:35:00,096 -->  00:35:02,682
I've been to a wedding here before.

369
00:35:05,643 -->  00:35:07,353
Funeral too.

370
00:35:09,772 -->  00:35:12,275
The professor wants to meet.

371
00:35:13,109 -->  00:35:17,238
I'd expected to hear from him sooner,
in light of recent events.

372
00:35:17,614 -->  00:35:22,619
He was wondering if it'd be convenient
for you to come by the college this afternoon.

373
00:35:22,785 -->  00:35:24,954
His lecture concludes at 4.

374
00:35:25,121 -->  00:35:26,122
Looking forward.

375
00:35:28,041 -->  00:35:29,083
One side, chummy.

376
00:35:53,983 -->  00:35:58,154
"Fischerweise," Schubert, 1826.

377
00:36:05,703 -->  00:36:09,457
- "Give up your foolish trickery."
- "This fish you cannot cheat."

378
00:36:09,999 -->  00:36:11,334
I hope I'm not intruding.

379
00:36:12,794 -->  00:36:15,129
Excuse me. 
Matthew, take these up to Mr. Williams.

380
00:36:15,296 -->  00:36:17,382
And make sure he packs
my white tie and tails.

381
00:36:17,549 -->  00:36:20,343
- I'll take care of it, professor.
- Thank you. I do apologize.

382
00:36:20,510 -->  00:36:24,514
I'm off on a blasted lecture tour.
Would you care for some tea or coffee?

383
00:36:24,681 -->  00:36:27,016
- Neither.
- Something stronger, perhaps?

384
00:36:27,183 -->  00:36:30,979
No, but might I trouble you
for an inscription?

385
00:36:49,163 -->  00:36:52,667
I read that the good doctor
was to be married today.

386
00:36:52,834 -->  00:36:54,210
How was the service?

387
00:36:54,377 -->  00:36:55,628
Definitive.

388
00:36:55,795 -->  00:36:59,924
He'll no longer be party to my investigations.
He's out of the equation.

389
00:37:01,676 -->  00:37:04,220
I trust you'll take this
into consideration.

390
00:37:08,057 -->  00:37:11,144
And what considerations
will you grant me?

391
00:37:19,319 -->  00:37:20,820
Have you actually read the book?

392
00:37:20,987 -->  00:37:23,156
I found it compelling...

393
00:37:23,323 -->  00:37:27,619
though I'm primarily interested
in your more recent endeavors.

394
00:37:28,453 -->  00:37:31,247
I take that as a compliment.

395
00:37:31,414 -->  00:37:34,292
I have the utmost regard for your talents.

396
00:37:35,251 -->  00:37:38,546
It's a pleasure to finally meet you...

397
00:37:39,589 -->  00:37:40,673
officially.

398
00:37:44,427 -->  00:37:47,597
Are you familiar
with the study of graphology?

399
00:37:47,930 -->  00:37:50,516
I've never given it
any serious thought, no.

400
00:37:50,683 -->  00:37:54,270
The psychological analysis of handwriting.

401
00:37:54,437 -->  00:37:59,233
The upward strokes on the P, the J, and the M
indicate a genius-level intellect.

402
00:37:59,692 -->  00:38:01,611
While the flourishes on the lower zone...

403
00:38:01,778 -->  00:38:04,822
denote a highly creative
yet meticulous nature.

404
00:38:04,989 -->  00:38:08,326
But if one observes the overall slant
and the pressure of the writing...

405
00:38:08,493 -->  00:38:12,955
there's a suggestion of acute narcissism,
a complete lack of empathy...

406
00:38:13,122 -->  00:38:15,667
- and a pronounced inclination toward--
- No.

407
00:38:15,833 -->  00:38:17,251
moral insanity.

408
00:38:18,378 -->  00:38:23,341
In answer to your previous request
regarding Dr. Watson not being involved...

409
00:38:23,508 -->  00:38:26,177
the answer is no.

410
00:38:27,679 -->  00:38:33,184
The laws of celestial mechanics dictate
that when two objects collide...

411
00:38:33,810 -->  00:38:37,689
there is always damage
of a collateral nature.

412
00:38:39,899 -->  00:38:42,110
<i>Exempli gratia.</i>

413
00:38:42,276 -->  00:38:46,406
Two gentlemen find themselves
at cross-purposes.

414
00:38:48,157 -->  00:38:51,119
<i>A young woman torn between them.</i>

415
00:38:51,662 -->  00:38:56,249
<i>The strain proves too much for her,
and she suddenly falls ill...</i>

416
00:38:56,958 -->  00:39:01,504
with tragic consequences.

417
00:39:04,132 -->  00:39:07,677
<i>A rare form of tuberculosis.</i>

418
00:39:07,844 -->  00:39:11,472
She succumbed in a matter of seconds.

419
00:39:14,392 -->  00:39:15,768
Now...

420
00:39:17,645 -->  00:39:20,148
are you sure you want
to play this game?

421
00:39:21,774 -->  00:39:24,318
I'm afraid you'd lose.

422
00:39:26,237 -->  00:39:32,076
Rest assured, if you attempt
to bring destruction down upon me...

423
00:39:32,243 -->  00:39:34,537
I shall do the same to you.

424
00:39:34,996 -->  00:39:40,251
My respect for you, Mr. Holmes,
is the only reason you're still alive.

425
00:39:42,462 -->  00:39:44,213
You've paid me several compliments.

426
00:39:44,380 -->  00:39:49,385
Let me pay you one in return when I say that
if I were assured of the former eventuality...

427
00:39:52,388 -->  00:39:54,640
I would cheerfully accept the latter.

428
00:39:58,519 -->  00:40:02,064
I'll be sure to send my regards
to the happy couple.

429
00:40:06,235 -->  00:40:08,279
Another time, then.

430
00:40:28,591 -->  00:40:31,135
All aboard for Brighton!
All aboard!

431
00:40:31,302 -->  00:40:32,553
Which coach are we?

432
00:40:32,720 -->  00:40:34,472
We should be just here.

433
00:40:37,517 -->  00:40:39,352
First class.

434
00:40:41,813 -->  00:40:44,816
All aboard for Brighton!
All aboard!

435
00:40:45,942 -->  00:40:48,069
Hurry up, Dr. Watson,
your wife needs you.

436
00:40:48,236 -->  00:40:50,404
Coming, Mrs. Watson.

437
00:40:52,281 -->  00:40:55,451
Oh. First class, champagne.

438
00:40:55,618 -->  00:40:58,120
You do know how to spoil a girl,
Mr. Watson.

439
00:40:58,287 -->  00:40:59,705
You're not just any girl.

440
00:41:01,249 -->  00:41:04,460
I'm sorry, madam. You can't use the lavatory
while the train's in the station.

441
00:41:08,548 -->  00:41:10,800
You're Mrs. Watson.

442
00:41:11,968 -->  00:41:14,136
Give me that bottle.

443
00:41:28,943 -->  00:41:31,654
John, there is nowhere else in the world
I would rather be.

444
00:41:31,821 -->  00:41:34,574
There's no one I'd rather be with.

445
00:41:34,740 -->  00:41:37,159
Why do you have a gun stuffed down
the back of your trousers?

446
00:41:38,326 -->  00:41:40,071
Old habits.

447
00:41:44,349 -->  00:41:45,477
Come in.

448
00:41:48,170 -->  00:41:50,381
- Oh, yes, please.
- We didn't order that.

449
00:41:50,548 -->  00:41:51,799
With our compliments, sir.

450
00:41:52,633 -->  00:41:54,760
Thank you. Put it there.

451
00:42:09,275 -->  00:42:10,568
Open the door, John.

452
00:42:14,113 -->  00:42:16,198
I think it's time for you to leave.

453
00:42:22,622 -->  00:42:24,248
Sit down.

454
00:42:28,961 -->  00:42:30,087
Shh.

455
00:42:48,314 -->  00:42:52,318
I agree it's not my best disguise,
but I had to make do.

456
00:42:53,819 -->  00:42:55,821
- My God.
- They'll be back.

457
00:42:55,988 -->  00:42:58,407
- John, shut the door.
- They'll only shoot through it.

458
00:42:58,574 -->  00:43:01,035
- He's right, you know.
- Oh, my God.

459
00:43:02,411 -->  00:43:04,330
- I understand.
- Do you?

460
00:43:04,497 -->  00:43:06,832
Terribly inconvenient.

461
00:43:07,750 -->  00:43:09,251
We don't have much time.

462
00:43:15,758 -->  00:43:17,677
- How many are we expecting?
- Half a dozen.

463
00:43:17,843 -->  00:43:20,262
- Who are they?
- A wedding present from Moriarty.

464
00:43:21,097 -->  00:43:23,307
Lovely ceremony, by the way.
Many a tear shed in joy.

465
00:43:23,474 -->  00:43:24,517
Oh, John?

466
00:43:25,893 -->  00:43:27,061
Yeah, just a minute, darling.

467
00:43:27,228 -->  00:43:29,563
- Do you trust me?
- No.

468
00:43:29,730 -->  00:43:33,401
Well, then I shall have to do
something about that.

469
00:43:40,449 -->  00:43:42,326
Who's up to bat next, you bastards?

470
00:43:43,703 -->  00:43:45,371
Send out the fast bowler!

471
00:43:45,538 -->  00:43:47,039
John, do shut the door.

472
00:43:52,878 -->  00:43:54,296
It had to be done.

473
00:43:55,339 -->  00:43:57,258
She's safe now.

474
00:44:00,011 -->  00:44:01,929
In my own defense,
I timed it perfectly.

475
00:44:02,972 -->  00:44:05,391
Did you kill my wife?!

476
00:44:05,558 -->  00:44:08,686
Did you just kill my new wife?!

477
00:44:08,853 -->  00:44:10,688
Of course not!

478
00:44:11,647 -->  00:44:16,110
What do you mean? How do you know that
when you just threw her off a train?

479
00:44:16,277 -->  00:44:18,487
I told you, I timed it perfectly.

480
00:44:18,654 -->  00:44:19,864
What does that mean?!

481
00:44:24,035 -->  00:44:25,745
- Calm down.
- Explain!

482
00:44:25,911 -->  00:44:28,080
By the time I've explained,
we'd both be dead!

483
00:44:40,301 -->  00:44:43,929
I'm sorry, madam. You can't use the lavatory
while the train's in the station.

484
00:45:37,691 -->  00:45:38,734
That was no accident.

485
00:45:40,402 -->  00:45:42,613
It was by design.

486
00:45:45,324 -->  00:45:49,703
Now, do you need me to elaborate...

487
00:45:51,080 -->  00:45:53,582
or can we just crack on?

488
00:46:00,464 -->  00:46:01,924
Come on!

489
00:46:04,552 -->  00:46:07,346
Don't worry, old boy,
she's as safe as houses.

490
00:46:07,513 -->  00:46:09,598
She's with my brother.

491
00:46:09,932 -->  00:46:12,726
I'm on my honeymoon!

492
00:46:12,893 -->  00:46:16,105
Why did you lead them here?!
Why did you involve us?!

493
00:46:16,272 -->  00:46:18,357
They aren't here for me!
They're here for you!

494
00:46:24,822 -->  00:46:26,323
Fortunately...

495
00:46:33,330 -->  00:46:34,790
so am I.

496
00:46:34,957 -->  00:46:36,333
Now mind the door.

497
00:46:37,835 -->  00:46:39,420
Good evening.

498
00:46:41,630 -->  00:46:45,009
I think you'll find that second class
is more comfortable.

499
00:46:45,175 -->  00:46:47,136
The coast is clear.

500
00:46:47,303 -->  00:46:48,804
To the south, quick march.

501
00:46:56,854 -->  00:46:58,814
Lie down with me, Watson.

502
00:46:59,481 -->  00:47:01,817
- Why?
- I insist.

503
00:47:09,033 -->  00:47:10,451
What are we doing down here?

504
00:47:10,743 -->  00:47:13,829
We are waiting. I am smoking.

505
00:47:33,891 -->  00:47:37,019
- Patiently waiting.
- For what?

506
00:47:37,645 -->  00:47:40,981
Your window of opportunity.

507
00:47:47,696 -->  00:47:49,114
Make it count.

508
00:47:56,538 -->  00:48:00,709
I said make it count.
How many windows must I provide?

509
00:48:21,563 -->  00:48:25,150
Who'd have known that honeymooning in Brighton
was such a dangerous notion?

510
00:48:25,317 -->  00:48:27,027
Is that what this is about?

511
00:48:27,194 -->  00:48:29,613
By your own admission,
you've never enjoyed it there.

512
00:48:29,780 -->  00:48:31,365
I've never been to Brighton.

513
00:48:31,532 -->  00:48:34,410
Or you're just too fragile
to remember at present.

514
00:48:34,576 -->  00:48:36,370
Oh, shut up.

515
00:48:36,537 -->  00:48:37,746
Tell me my wife's safe.

516
00:48:37,913 -->  00:48:39,623
I can't do both.

517
00:48:39,790 -->  00:48:43,210
I promise. As I said,
I timed it perfectly.

518
00:48:50,175 -->  00:48:52,928
Over here, madam!

519
00:48:53,762 -->  00:48:57,558
I believe congratulations are in order,
Mrs. Watson.

520
00:49:00,144 -->  00:49:03,147
I'm the other Holmes.

521
00:49:04,148 -->  00:49:05,524
You mean there's two of you?

522
00:49:05,691 -->  00:49:08,402
How marvelous.
Could this evening get any better?

523
00:49:08,569 -->  00:49:10,821
Why were Mary and I targeted at all?

524
00:49:11,280 -->  00:49:14,324
Excellent question.
The answer is twofold.

525
00:49:14,491 -->  00:49:16,410
He's after us because of you.

526
00:49:16,577 -->  00:49:19,371
I'm afraid you must bear
half the responsibility.

527
00:49:19,538 -->  00:49:21,957
- Here it comes. So predictable.
- Had you and Mary...

528
00:49:22,124 -->  00:49:25,085
not been hell-bent on wedding,
we could've solved this case.

529
00:49:25,252 -->  00:49:27,796
- Oh, it's my fault now.
- The argument could be made...

530
00:49:27,963 -->  00:49:30,632
- No, it couldn't.
- that your nuptials were poorly timed.

531
00:49:32,426 -->  00:49:34,511
Thus, our relationship--

532
00:49:35,846 -->  00:49:36,889
Relationship?

533
00:49:37,598 -->  00:49:39,183
Very well, partnership.

534
00:49:39,349 -->  00:49:42,436
has not yet run its course.

535
00:49:42,853 -->  00:49:46,648
My dear fellow, if you could be bothered
to see this through to the end...

536
00:49:47,357 -->  00:49:50,402
I shall never again ask you
to assist me.

537
00:49:55,365 -->  00:49:57,993
Once more unto the breach.

538
00:49:58,160 -->  00:50:00,454
That's the spirit.
Now, to the question.

539
00:50:00,621 -->  00:50:03,624
This is so deliciously complicated.
You may be asking yourself...

540
00:50:03,791 -->  00:50:07,795
what does a criminal mastermind want
with a simple gypsy fortune teller?

541
00:50:07,961 -->  00:50:11,256
It's her brother, I tell you.
When we find him, and we must--

542
00:50:11,423 -->  00:50:13,008
After you find my luggage.

543
00:50:14,927 -->  00:50:16,136
Go on.

544
00:50:16,595 -->  00:50:17,971
Wait.

545
00:50:18,514 -->  00:50:19,890
Where is it we're going?

546
00:50:20,390 -->  00:50:24,019
Paris, the most sensible
honeymoon destination of all.

547
00:50:47,876 -->  00:50:50,546
- So why Paris?
- Peaches.

548
00:50:50,712 -->  00:50:52,297
Outside the city at Montreuil...

549
00:50:52,464 -->  00:50:57,302
there's a Gypsy camp famous
for its dried fruit, especially peaches.

550
00:50:58,387 -->  00:51:02,641
And there we shall find our fortune teller...

551
00:51:02,808 -->  00:51:05,018
and return her bag.

552
00:52:20,969 -->  00:52:23,472
And my ticket?

553
00:52:36,026 -->  00:52:39,363
Unfortunately, you won't be needing yours.

554
00:52:39,696 -->  00:52:44,993
That's a shame, professor.
I was looking forward to <i>Don Giovanni.</i>

555
00:52:54,169 -->  00:52:56,338
Follow Meinhard.

556
00:53:35,919 -->  00:53:36,962
Wake up, we're here.

557
00:53:37,129 -->  00:53:39,339
Brace yourself.
We're about to be violated.

558
00:53:39,506 -->  00:53:41,508
Don't be so cynical.

559
00:53:50,392 -->  00:53:54,062
- They're taking my luggage.
- Laugh them away, Watson. I have her bag.

560
00:53:56,898 -->  00:53:59,609
You had her bag.

561
00:54:00,527 -->  00:54:01,695
Now they have my coat.

562
00:54:03,030 -->  00:54:05,198
Where is Madam Simza?

563
00:54:08,035 -->  00:54:09,411
This is Simza.

564
00:54:15,584 -->  00:54:17,377
Sim is a goose.

565
00:54:19,046 -->  00:54:20,080
I am Sim.

566
00:54:24,801 -->  00:54:27,679
Nice scarf. I like.

567
00:54:51,161 -->  00:54:53,246
- You hungry?
- Famished.

568
00:54:58,293 -->  00:55:00,796
Madam, this is a glorious hedgehog goulash.

569
00:55:00,962 -->  00:55:04,549
I can't remember ever having had better.

570
00:55:07,969 -->  00:55:11,807
Do tell me, when was the last time
you had a hedgehog goulash?

571
00:55:11,973 -->  00:55:14,518
I told you, Watson,
I can't remember.

572
00:55:14,684 -->  00:55:16,436
Perhaps you've repressed it.

573
00:55:17,854 -->  00:55:21,233
That's where we differ.
Unlike you, I repress nothing.

574
00:55:21,400 -->  00:55:22,984
Perfectly normal.

575
00:55:23,735 -->  00:55:27,989
How dare you be rude to this woman
who has invited us into her tent...

576
00:55:28,156 -->  00:55:29,741
offered us her hedgehog?

577
00:55:29,908 -->  00:55:33,662
Says the man who throws women from trains.

578
00:55:35,497 -->  00:55:36,706
Who are you two?

579
00:55:37,082 -->  00:55:38,583
Concerned citizens.

580
00:55:39,584 -->  00:55:41,461
Why did someone try to kill me?

581
00:55:42,421 -->  00:55:46,049
Your brother has become involved
with a very dangerous man...

582
00:55:46,216 -->  00:55:49,886
who clearly believes that Rene
has told you something you shouldn't know.

583
00:55:51,847 -->  00:55:53,181
I don't know anything.

584
00:55:54,641 -->  00:55:57,102
I've been looking for him for over a year.

585
00:55:57,269 -->  00:55:59,396
That was why I was in London.

586
00:55:59,563 -->  00:56:03,150
- It's the last place anyone saw him.
- It's clear that your brother loves you.

587
00:56:03,316 -->  00:56:06,278
He'd never send you a message
that would put you in harm's way.

588
00:56:06,445 -->  00:56:10,157
Any information, therefore, would be,
by default, unintentional.

589
00:56:10,574 -->  00:56:12,409
Has he sent you anything else?

590
00:56:13,493 -->  00:56:14,828
Just a few drawings.

591
00:56:15,370 -->  00:56:17,456
Let's just see what they have to tell us.

592
00:56:24,504 -->  00:56:28,633
Unusual choice of paper.
Thicker gauge, designed for a printing press.

593
00:56:28,842 -->  00:56:31,595
- And it's the same stock as the letter.
- Mm.

594
00:56:32,179 -->  00:56:33,930
They smell musty.

595
00:56:34,097 -->  00:56:37,684
Must have been stored
somewhere cold and damp.

596
00:56:38,226 -->  00:56:40,395
What's that? Blood?

597
00:56:42,272 -->  00:56:46,568
Wine. So a wine cellar located
near a printing press.

598
00:56:46,735 -->  00:56:48,153
That should narrow it down.

599
00:56:53,116 -->  00:56:56,661
There's a wine cellar used
by the anarchist group <i>Lapin Vert.</i>

600
00:56:56,828 -->  00:56:59,206
Rene was close to their leader.

601
00:56:59,372 -->  00:57:00,790
Claude Ravache.

602
00:57:00,957 -->  00:57:04,461
- A bomb maker.
- I sampled some of his work last week.

603
00:57:05,921 -->  00:57:09,716
I was a part of the movement.
So was Rene.

604
00:57:09,883 -->  00:57:12,427
Until it became too extreme for us.

605
00:57:13,553 -->  00:57:15,764
Ravache knows me.

606
00:57:16,097 -->  00:57:20,477
If my brother's back there,
he will see us.

607
00:57:20,644 -->  00:57:21,770
We will send a message.

608
00:57:31,655 -->  00:57:34,824
Whatever you do,
don't let these gypsies make you drink.

609
00:57:34,991 -->  00:57:36,034
Of course.

610
00:57:36,618 -->  00:57:37,953
You dance?

611
00:57:38,787 -->  00:57:41,790
For God's sake, don't dance.
It'll be the death of you.

612
00:57:47,254 -->  00:57:48,713
You know what happens when you dance.

613
00:58:15,907 -->  00:58:17,867
Oh, good morning, Mrs. Watson.

614
00:58:18,493 -->  00:58:20,078
- Have you had breakfast?
- I--

615
00:58:20,245 -->  00:58:22,997
Stanley here does
a wonderful deviled kidney.

616
00:58:24,624 -->  00:58:26,376
- Carruthers?
- Morning, sir.

617
00:58:26,543 -->  00:58:28,962
Telegram for Mrs. Watson.

618
00:58:35,510 -->  00:58:36,595
Uh....

619
00:58:36,761 -->  00:58:38,471
It just doesn't make any sense.

620
00:58:38,972 -->  00:58:40,015
Allow me.

621
00:58:41,725 -->  00:58:42,851
Oh, yes.

622
00:58:43,018 -->  00:58:47,355
"My most loathed Mary, I do not love you.
I never wish to see you again.

623
00:58:47,522 -->  00:58:51,610
Every moment I count away from you
is a blessing."

624
00:58:51,776 -->  00:58:54,404
Fret not.
It's a double encryption, my dear...

625
00:58:54,571 -->  00:58:57,741
that Sherly and I have used
since we were boys.

626
00:58:57,907 -->  00:59:00,869
If the first letter of the message
is a consonant...

627
00:59:01,036 -->  00:59:04,080
then what follows is the mirrored truth.

628
00:59:04,247 -->  00:59:05,540
- I see.
- Hmm.

629
00:59:07,334 -->  00:59:09,044
Stanley!

630
00:59:09,878 -->  00:59:13,131
You know, although our time together
has been but a brief interlude...

631
00:59:13,298 -->  00:59:17,552
I'm beginning to understand
how a man of particular disposition...

632
00:59:17,719 -->  00:59:22,641
under certain circumstances,
extreme ones perhaps...

633
00:59:22,807 -->  00:59:27,020
might grow to enjoy the company of...

634
00:59:27,187 -->  00:59:33,193
- a person of your gender. Hmm.
- Hmm.

635
00:59:33,360 -->  00:59:35,236
Thank you so much.

636
00:59:35,403 -->  00:59:37,530
Most charming.

637
00:59:38,073 -->  00:59:41,284
May--? Terribly sorry.
Thank you.

638
00:59:42,952 -->  00:59:44,996
Where are you going, Stanley?

639
01:00:01,388 -->  01:00:03,556
Whoa, whoa.

640
01:00:54,149 -->  01:00:56,067
Still hiding in basements?

641
01:01:06,327 -->  01:01:08,288
I'm not here to see you.

642
01:01:11,499 -->  01:01:12,500
Yeah.

643
01:01:16,337 -->  01:01:17,922
...with your English friends.

644
01:01:20,717 -->  01:01:24,095
1789, a seminal vintage.

645
01:01:24,262 -->  01:01:26,347
The year of our glorious revolution.

646
01:01:26,514 -->  01:01:29,017
- Is he here?
- When freedom triumphed over tyranny.

647
01:01:29,184 -->  01:01:30,185
Is my brother here?

648
01:01:31,311 -->  01:01:33,813
I haven't seen him for a long time.

649
01:01:33,980 -->  01:01:35,023
You're lying.

650
01:01:36,274 -->  01:01:38,193
Sit, please.

651
01:01:41,112 -->  01:01:44,240
A letter was received from Rene
using this same paper.

652
01:01:44,407 -->  01:01:46,618
Of course. He took it with him
wherever he went.

653
01:01:47,911 -->  01:01:49,871
He's telling the truth.
Rene isn't here.

654
01:01:50,038 -->  01:01:53,333
- He was given another assignment by an--
- An anonymous benefactor.

655
01:01:56,252 -->  01:01:57,879
Another Englishman...

656
01:01:58,421 -->  01:02:02,217
with money, power,
who supported our cause.

657
01:02:02,926 -->  01:02:04,427
And now...

658
01:02:05,053 -->  01:02:07,847
he dictates our every move...

659
01:02:13,353 -->  01:02:17,982
demanding I take responsibility
for his acts of terror.

660
01:02:18,691 -->  01:02:20,485
I made a deal with the devil.

661
01:02:20,652 -->  01:02:22,487
But after tonight...

662
01:02:23,696 -->  01:02:24,989
it will be over.

663
01:02:26,741 -->  01:02:28,701
My job is almost done.

664
01:02:30,912 -->  01:02:34,207
He's had you plant another bomb,
hasn't he?

665
01:02:34,374 -->  01:02:36,000
Claude, please.

666
01:02:36,292 -->  01:02:37,794
These men can help you.

667
01:02:38,586 -->  01:02:40,547
I wish they could.

668
01:02:41,256 -->  01:02:43,174
You see, gentlemen...

669
01:02:44,592 -->  01:02:46,052
he has my wife and children.

670
01:02:47,512 -->  01:02:49,138
If you tell us where the bomb is...

671
01:02:49,305 -->  01:02:52,600
- I'll find a way to help your family.
- That's already taken care of.

672
01:02:53,101 -->  01:02:54,978
We have a deal.

673
01:02:57,730 -->  01:02:59,732
He and I.

674
01:03:01,192 -->  01:03:02,902
No loose ends.

675
01:03:03,528 -->  01:03:06,739
There's only one thing I can do
to keep my family safe.

676
01:03:07,448 -->  01:03:10,159
- You have less than 10 minutes.
- Don't!

677
01:03:22,171 -->  01:03:26,467
He has no further need of that pistol.
Why don't you take it and cover the stairs?

678
01:03:59,459 -->  01:04:01,294
There's only one way out of this place.

679
01:04:03,004 -->  01:04:04,088
Right you are.

680
01:04:08,718 -->  01:04:10,887
Ah. Ingenious.

681
01:04:11,054 -->  01:04:13,139
That's the one.
Quickly as we can.

682
01:04:16,267 -->  01:04:18,895
You know what to do with that sandbag, Watson.

683
01:04:19,687 -->  01:04:21,397
Quick now.

684
01:04:28,655 -->  01:04:30,657
Doctor, could you secure that lever?

685
01:04:32,033 -->  01:04:33,326
You could have told me.

686
01:04:34,077 -->  01:04:37,872
Ravache was strong. He lived for liberty.
He would never take his own life.

687
01:04:38,039 -->  01:04:39,165
Calm yourself.

688
01:04:45,421 -->  01:04:47,298
My brother, he's weak.

689
01:04:47,882 -->  01:04:51,052
Sim, I need you to take a deep breath...

690
01:04:51,219 -->  01:04:52,428
and follow us.

691
01:04:55,056 -->  01:04:56,808
To the opera.

692
01:07:31,129 -->  01:07:33,131
I was mistaken.

693
01:07:33,297 -->  01:07:36,425
- What?
- I made a mistake.

694
01:09:26,619 -->  01:09:28,204
He took the shot from here.

695
01:09:29,997 -->  01:09:32,833
Using a tripod and a shooting stick.

696
01:09:33,000 -->  01:09:35,878
And realized there was a better position.

697
01:09:36,379 -->  01:09:41,509
There's a faint scrape
where he dragged his tripod and set it up here.

698
01:09:42,343 -->  01:09:44,595
- Six hundred yards?
- Or 650?

699
01:09:44,762 -->  01:09:47,223
 Not to mention a seven-
or eight-mile-an-hour wind.

700
01:09:47,390 -->  01:09:49,892
He would've needed a wind gauge.

701
01:09:50,726 -->  01:09:52,270
Which he placed here.

702
01:09:55,022 -->  01:09:56,857
And put a cigarette down here.

703
01:09:59,068 -->  01:10:00,653
Can anyone shoot that far?

704
01:10:00,820 -->  01:10:03,531
Not more than half a dozen men
in all of Europe.

705
01:10:04,615 -->  01:10:06,659
How many of those men served in Afghanistan?

706
01:10:06,826 -->  01:10:09,412
- Why?
- Hirschsprung with a touch of Tekel.

707
01:10:09,578 -->  01:10:11,831
<i>Must have fallen out
when he was rolling up.</i>

708
01:10:11,998 -->  01:10:13,874
Wasn't that the blend you all smoked?

709
01:10:16,043 -->  01:10:19,005
- Didn't I read something about a colonel?
- Sebastian Moran.

710
01:10:20,131 -->  01:10:22,341
<i>Best marksman in the British army.</i>

711
01:10:22,508 -->  01:10:24,510
Dishonorable discharge.

712
01:10:24,677 -->  01:10:29,348
He's likely now a gun for hire.
This is the second victim of his that I've encountered.

713
01:10:29,515 -->  01:10:31,225
What better way to conceal a killing?

714
01:10:31,392 -->  01:10:33,728
No one looks for a bullet hole
in a bomb blast.

715
01:10:47,450 -->  01:10:49,744
- He's 20 minutes late.
- He must come soon.

716
01:10:50,745 -->  01:10:51,954
I don't have any papers.

717
01:10:52,455 -->  01:10:54,290
And I am a foreigner.

718
01:10:54,457 -->  01:10:56,751
This climate is exactly what Moriarty wants.

719
01:10:57,617 -->  01:11:00,671
The omelet fines herbes was divine... 

720
01:11:00,838 -->  01:11:03,424
but they spared every expense on the tea.

721
01:11:04,258 -->  01:11:08,471
Now shall we compare moods,
or consider what we know?

722
01:11:09,597 -->  01:11:11,474
<i>Last night's bombing
was clearly meant...</i>

723
01:11:11,640 -->  01:11:14,560
<i>to look like Germany's retaliation
for Strasbourg.</i>

724
01:11:14,727 -->  01:11:18,439
<i>However, the bomb was also meant
to conceal the murder of just one man.</i>

725
01:11:19,023 -->  01:11:23,110
The man killed by the gunshot
was none other than Alfred Meinhard.

726
01:11:25,946 -->  01:11:29,158
He makes guns. Big guns.

727
01:11:29,617 -->  01:11:33,662
Only days ago, a large share of his company
was bought by an unknown investor.

728
01:11:33,829 -->  01:11:34,997
Moriarty.

729
01:11:35,164 -->  01:11:39,710
The clues point in one direction,
but to avoid repeating last night's debacle...

730
01:11:39,877 -->  01:11:43,756
I was obliged to collect more sufficient data,
hence my tardiness.

731
01:11:50,721 -->  01:11:53,974
Train departs in 40 minutes, sir.

732
01:12:09,073 -->  01:12:10,366
Whoa!

733
01:12:18,332 -->  01:12:21,961
- Just the bags.
- But....

734
01:12:22,128 -->  01:12:25,089
We have enough time for me
to indulge my little habit.

735
01:12:25,256 -->  01:12:26,298
Yes.

736
01:12:26,465 -->  01:12:31,637
<i>His habit of feeding that urban species,
the feral pigeon.</i>

737
01:12:33,639 -->  01:12:36,809
So there are seven
mainline railway stations in Paris.

738
01:12:36,976 -->  01:12:39,854
But taking 10 minutes to get
to the Jardin des Tuileries...

739
01:12:40,062 -->  01:12:43,649
where the largest concentration
of the winged vermin may be found...

740
01:12:43,816 -->  01:12:46,902
reduces there to one,
the Gare du Nord...

741
01:12:47,069 -->  01:12:52,241
where he will be just in time
to catch the 11:04 train to Berlin.

742
01:12:52,408 -->  01:12:54,952
It makes several stops along the way,
one of which is--

743
01:12:55,119 -->  01:12:56,829
Heilbronn.

744
01:12:57,580 -->  01:13:00,082
Exactly where we must go.

745
01:13:00,541 -->  01:13:02,042
Where Meinhard's factory is.

746
01:13:02,209 -->  01:13:04,211
It's Moriarty's factory now.

747
01:13:04,879 -->  01:13:06,547
Unfortunately, due to the bombing...

748
01:13:06,714 -->  01:13:09,467
the crossing between France and Germany
is to be closed.

749
01:13:10,342 -->  01:13:14,430
I'm afraid our pursuit is over
unless we can happen upon a comrade...

750
01:13:14,597 -->  01:13:18,225
who knows their way around borders.

751
01:13:19,643 -->  01:13:21,061
Too English.

752
01:13:23,397 -->  01:13:25,733
However, you do make a fantastic gypsy.

753
01:13:25,900 -->  01:13:27,902
Certainly smell like a fantastic gypsy.

754
01:13:28,068 -->  01:13:30,863
Now, now, no need to be demeaning.

755
01:13:31,071 -->  01:13:33,240
It is a nice scarf.

756
01:13:33,407 -->  01:13:36,076
No, no, too English.
It'll suit you more.

757
01:13:37,411 -->  01:13:40,247
Black one is yours.
Gray one is mine.

758
01:13:40,414 -->  01:13:43,375
- And this is for you.
- Um... Hmm.

759
01:13:43,542 -->  01:13:44,710
Right.

760
01:13:45,711 -->  01:13:48,172
- Where are the wagons?
- The wagon is too slow.

761
01:13:48,339 -->  01:13:49,757
Can't you ride?

762
01:13:52,343 -->  01:13:54,553
It's not that he can't ride.

763
01:13:54,720 -->  01:13:56,096
How is it you put it, Holmes?

764
01:13:56,263 -->  01:13:59,934
They're dangerous at both ends
and crafty in the middle.

765
01:14:00,100 -->  01:14:04,438
Why would I want anything with a mind of its own 
bobbing about between my legs?

766
01:14:04,605 -->  01:14:07,107
Then I shall require a bicycle,
thank you very much.

767
01:14:07,274 -->  01:14:10,402
It's 1891.
Could've chartered a balloon.

768
01:14:13,030 -->  01:14:15,199
How can we make this more manageable?

769
01:14:28,170 -->  01:14:29,630
Where's the fire?

770
01:14:38,514 -->  01:14:41,475
It's not as if Germany is going somewhere.

771
01:14:50,693 -->  01:14:51,902
We know another way.

772
01:14:57,950 -->  01:15:00,786
Slow and steady wins the race.

773
01:15:18,095 -->  01:15:19,763
Come on!

774
01:15:35,154 -->  01:15:39,366
We slip in through the loading bay,
find out what he's doing...

775
01:15:39,533 -->  01:15:41,327
and we get out.

776
01:15:41,493 -->  01:15:43,162
Getting out might be tricky.

777
01:15:43,329 -->  01:15:44,747
We will get you out.

778
01:15:44,913 -->  01:15:47,916
If my brother's in there,
get him out alive.

779
01:16:04,558 -->  01:16:05,809
Are you happy?

780
01:16:07,311 -->  01:16:09,146
- What?
- At this moment...

781
01:16:09,313 -->  01:16:13,275
are you as happy as you would be
on your honeymoon in Brighton?

782
01:16:13,776 -->  01:16:16,570
I'm not going to grace that question
with an answer.

783
01:16:19,114 -->  01:16:21,658
- Are you happy?
- I think we're here for another reason.

784
01:16:21,825 -->  01:16:23,035
- Okay.
- Shall we get on--?

785
01:16:23,202 -->  01:16:25,037
- Simple question.
- Will we do something?

786
01:16:25,204 -->  01:16:27,748
- Or wait for them to come back round?
- What time is it?

787
01:16:28,791 -->  01:16:30,125
- Three-fifteen.
- Over there...

788
01:16:30,292 -->  01:16:33,629
in the residential part of the complex
should be a telegraph office.

789
01:16:33,796 -->  01:16:37,174
Send this to Mycroft.
Be back here on the hour.

790
01:19:27,344 -->  01:19:31,807
That's what you get, Mr. Holmes,
when industry marries arms.

791
01:19:31,974 -->  01:19:34,184
Now put your gun down.

792
01:19:35,143 -->  01:19:37,479
It's a bit old-fashioned.

793
01:19:42,317 -->  01:19:44,152
What you need is one of these.

794
01:19:45,779 -->  01:19:47,281
Go on.

795
01:19:49,533 -->  01:19:50,617
Pick one.

796
01:19:53,453 -->  01:19:56,415
Machine pistol, self-repeating.

797
01:19:58,083 -->  01:20:01,587
Takes 7.63 caliber rounds...

798
01:20:02,212 -->  01:20:04,256
in one of these.

799
01:20:07,050 -->  01:20:09,344
A 10-shot box magazine.

800
01:20:11,388 -->  01:20:13,974
- Easy enough to load.
- Hmm.

801
01:20:14,141 -->  01:20:17,519
I'd imagine one would have to retract the bolt
to engage the first round.

802
01:20:19,062 -->  01:20:20,439
Easier done than said.

803
01:20:29,865 -->  01:20:31,408
Take him to the surgery.

804
01:20:32,701 -->  01:20:35,162
I'll find the doctor.

805
01:20:46,214 -->  01:20:48,508
"Come at once if convenient.

806
01:20:50,886 -->  01:20:53,930
If inconvenient, come all the same."

807
01:21:05,817 -->  01:21:06,860
This is schnapps.

808
01:21:08,111 -->  01:21:11,198
A telegram was sent from here.

809
01:21:12,574 -->  01:21:16,411
This isn't schnapps, it's aquavit,
distilled from potato mash.

810
01:21:16,578 -->  01:21:19,081
A common misconception.
Thank you, by the way.

811
01:21:19,873 -->  01:21:21,875
Who was it sent to?

812
01:21:22,042 -->  01:21:24,002
My horror at your crimes
is matched only...

813
01:21:24,169 -->  01:21:27,089
by my admiration at the skill
it took to achieve them.

814
01:21:28,882 -->  01:21:30,384
Who was it sent to?

815
01:21:31,551 -->  01:21:35,138
<i>You used the anarchists and their bombs
to create a crisis in Europe...</i>

816
01:21:35,305 -->  01:21:36,765
<i>nation against nation.</i>

817
01:21:37,099 -->  01:21:40,686
Under various pseudonyms,
you bought, schemed, or murdered your way...

818
01:21:40,852 -->  01:21:44,439
into numerous industries,
assuring that none of it could be traced to you.

819
01:21:44,898 -->  01:21:48,860
<i>Cotton, opium, steel,
now arms and chemical weaponry.</i>

820
01:21:49,027 -->  01:21:52,280
<i>All to be shipped across Europe
in less than a week.</i>

821
01:21:52,447 -->  01:21:54,658
<i>Everything from bullets to bandages.</i>

822
01:21:55,659 -->  01:21:59,413
Now that you own the supply,
you intend to create the demand.

823
01:22:01,456 -->  01:22:02,791
A world war.

824
01:22:07,212 -->  01:22:09,089
<i>You are familiar with Schubert's work.</i>

825
01:22:13,760 -->  01:22:17,723
<i>The Trout</i> is perhaps my favorite.

826
01:22:19,725 -->  01:22:24,604
A fisherman grows weary
of trying to catch an elusive fish.

827
01:22:25,772 -->  01:22:27,899
Out the way, out the way.

828
01:22:28,984 -->  01:22:30,402
So he muddies the water.

829
01:22:31,027 -->  01:22:32,529
I'm warning you.

830
01:22:33,029 -->  01:22:34,489
Confuses the fish.

831
01:22:40,370 -->  01:22:41,580
You were warned.

832
01:22:41,747 -->  01:22:45,625
It doesn't realize until too late
that it has swum into a trap.

833
01:24:30,605 -->  01:24:32,649
Let's try this again, shall we?

834
01:24:33,066 -->  01:24:36,778
To whom did you send the telegram?

835
01:24:37,529 -->  01:24:39,281
To my....

836
01:24:52,210 -->  01:24:54,254
To my brother Mycroft.

837
01:24:57,465 -->  01:24:59,092
What are you playing at?

838
01:25:03,305 -->  01:25:05,432
That's not fair.

839
01:25:07,142 -->  01:25:09,311
I've just got one more question for you.

840
01:25:15,650 -->  01:25:17,527
Which one of us is the fisherman...

841
01:25:18,361 -->  01:25:20,196
and which the trout?

842
01:25:50,935 -->  01:25:52,062
Holmes?

843
01:25:54,272 -->  01:25:55,440
Holmes?

844
01:25:55,607 -->  01:25:58,943
Take your time. Take your time.

845
01:26:04,115 -->  01:26:05,367
Uh....

846
01:26:11,915 -->  01:26:13,583
Always good to see you, Watson.

847
01:26:29,140 -->  01:26:30,725
- What were you thinking?
- Wait.

848
01:26:30,892 -->  01:26:32,102
Wait?

849
01:26:33,645 -->  01:26:38,191
Well, if you must know, I was thinking
I had him right where I wanted him.

850
01:26:42,195 -->  01:26:44,781
Right. Crack on, then.

851
01:26:50,954 -->  01:26:52,205
Professor.

852
01:26:52,706 -->  01:26:55,166
I'm all right, I'm all right.

853
01:26:55,333 -->  01:26:58,044
Don't waste time attending to me.

854
01:27:02,507 -->  01:27:04,968
I'll find them. I'll find them.

855
01:27:11,850 -->  01:27:14,477
Turn in three, two, one.

856
01:27:23,236 -->  01:27:24,237
Come on, hurry up!

857
01:27:28,450 -->  01:27:29,784
Go!

858
01:27:39,127 -->  01:27:42,088
- Did you see my brother?
- No, but I'm certain he's been here.

859
01:27:42,255 -->  01:27:44,007
- Where are we going?
- Over that wall.

860
01:27:44,174 -->  01:27:46,593
- How did you know I'd find you?
- You didn't find me.

861
01:27:46,760 -->  01:27:48,595
You collapsed a building on me.

862
01:28:41,439 -->  01:28:43,316
- Where are the horses?
- They're behind.

863
01:28:43,483 -->  01:28:45,902
- We need them.
- You wanna go back?

864
01:28:46,069 -->  01:28:47,278
What's our way out?

865
01:28:47,445 -->  01:28:48,822
That's our way out.

866
01:32:09,451 -->  01:32:11,412
Go! Go!

867
01:32:13,289 -->  01:32:14,540
Come on!

868
01:32:30,306 -->  01:32:32,725
Marko! Marko!

869
01:33:24,485 -->  01:33:25,611
He's not breathing.

870
01:33:34,370 -->  01:33:35,412
Cradle his head.

871
01:33:35,954 -->  01:33:37,665
Raise his legs.

872
01:33:39,500 -->  01:33:42,169
Bloody well not gonna die on me.

873
01:33:46,882 -->  01:33:48,967
I'm not gonna make this easy on you.

874
01:33:50,594 -->  01:33:53,097
Come on. Come on.

875
01:33:53,263 -->  01:33:54,932
Come on.

876
01:33:59,937 -->  01:34:01,021
Come on.

877
01:34:01,188 -->  01:34:03,399
I know you can hear me,
you selfish bastard.

878
01:34:03,899 -->  01:34:05,484
Come on!

879
01:34:05,651 -->  01:34:07,945
I know you can hear me, you bastard.

880
01:34:28,257 -->  01:34:29,425
His wedding gift.

881
01:34:50,779 -->  01:34:52,698
Terrible dream.

882
01:34:52,865 -->  01:34:55,075
You, Mary, Gladstone and I
were in a restaurant.

883
01:34:55,242 -->  01:34:58,287
That satanic pony was there as well,
a massive fork in his hoof...

884
01:34:58,454 -->  01:35:00,414
and he turned on me!

885
01:35:00,581 -->  01:35:02,499
What have you administered?

886
01:35:03,417 -->  01:35:04,460
Your wedding present.

887
01:35:04,626 -->  01:35:06,879
Who's been dancing on my chest?!

888
01:35:07,045 -->  01:35:08,338
Me.

889
01:35:09,173 -->  01:35:10,799
Why is my ankle so itchy?

890
01:35:10,966 -->  01:35:13,385
You have a large piece of wood
sticking out of it.

891
01:35:13,552 -->  01:35:15,596
Good Lord. You, Tamas.

892
01:35:15,763 -->  01:35:18,974
I have an important job to discuss with you.
Remind me of it later.

893
01:35:19,141 -->  01:35:21,894
Sit down. Drink this.

894
01:35:22,060 -->  01:35:24,646
I need to get that out
before it turns septic.

895
01:35:28,025 -->  01:35:31,361
- Did you call me "selfish bastard"?
- Probably.

896
01:35:32,154 -->  01:35:34,114
Just leave it in. Leave it--!

897
01:35:37,951 -->  01:35:39,077
You are a--

898
01:35:39,244 -->  01:35:42,164
- Oh, you are some sort of--
- Be nice.

899
01:35:50,631 -->  01:35:52,716
I'm sorry you didn't get to Brighton.

900
01:35:56,678 -->  01:35:58,013
Me too.

901
01:36:04,812 -->  01:36:06,855
- I think we should go home.
- I concur.

902
01:36:08,273 -->  01:36:09,566
We're going home.

903
01:36:15,781 -->  01:36:17,741
Via Switzerland.

904
01:36:19,868 -->  01:36:24,122
What better place to start a war
than a peace summit?

905
01:36:25,040 -->  01:36:30,504
We'll drop in and see my brother.
I'm sure he's missed you. Hm?

906
01:36:47,104 -->  01:36:49,481
I don't understand why you don't
cancel the summit.

907
01:36:49,648 -->  01:36:52,067
Fact is it's gonna happen
whether we like it or not.

908
01:36:52,401 -->  01:36:54,319
Everyone has already arrived.

909
01:36:54,486 -->  01:36:56,697
Although these gentlemen
may be talking peace...

910
01:36:56,864 -->  01:36:59,283
believe me, they're readying
their armies at home.

911
01:36:59,449 -->  01:37:01,910
To cancel the summit now
would be tantamount to war.

912
01:37:02,077 -->  01:37:05,414
- The telegram, wasn't it clear?
- We have doubled the security, sir.

913
01:37:05,581 -->  01:37:07,749
Oh, doubled security.
That's comforting.

914
01:37:07,916 -->  01:37:10,794
You don't understand
the delicacy of the situation.

915
01:37:10,961 -->  01:37:12,838
I passed the telegram on to my superiors.

916
01:37:13,005 -->  01:37:16,717
But they brought Moriarty in to advise
on the peace process in the first place.

917
01:37:16,884 -->  01:37:19,011
He has positioned himself brilliantly.

918
01:37:19,177 -->  01:37:21,889
He's one of our foremost intellectuals,
he's a personal friend--

919
01:37:22,055 -->  01:37:24,224
Of the prime minister.
Yes, we all know that.

920
01:37:24,391 -->  01:37:27,227
I believe you,
but where's your evidence?

921
01:37:28,437 -->  01:37:31,231
He's too good to leave evidence.

922
01:37:31,398 -->  01:37:32,774
He doesn't leave loose ends.

923
01:37:33,483 -->  01:37:35,819
Oh, he's alive.

924
01:37:35,986 -->  01:37:37,112
Sherly, put that down.

925
01:37:37,779 -->  01:37:41,199
What is this contraption? May I have it?
The effect is most invigorating.

926
01:37:41,366 -->  01:37:45,412
That's my private and personal supply of oxygen,
and you're not to touch it.

927
01:37:47,122 -->  01:37:48,790
This argument is getting us nowhere.

928
01:37:48,957 -->  01:37:52,878
I've arranged for documents to be prepared
which allow you into the ball. Carruthers.

929
01:37:53,045 -->  01:37:56,048
Stanley, Stanley.

930
01:37:56,214 -->  01:38:00,594
You haven't aged a day.
Is that my favorite chutney?

931
01:38:00,761 -->  01:38:03,764
Fact is, we don't really know
what he's planning.

932
01:38:04,723 -->  01:38:07,100
- It won't be another bomb.
- No, it wouldn't be.

933
01:38:07,267 -->  01:38:08,769
It doesn't make sense.

934
01:38:08,936 -->  01:38:11,563
Why would he attack all the nations
only to unite them?

935
01:38:11,730 -->  01:38:13,106
It'll be an assassination.

936
01:38:14,483 -->  01:38:16,610
By a lone gunman at close range.

937
01:38:18,320 -->  01:38:19,571
Rene.

938
01:38:20,280 -->  01:38:21,698
Unfortunately, yes.

939
01:38:22,950 -->  01:38:25,285
- You knew.
- I had my suspicions.

940
01:38:25,452 -->  01:38:28,497
But having seen who would be attending,
I'm now certain.

941
01:38:28,664 -->  01:38:31,333
Well, at least we know
who to look out for.

942
01:38:32,000 -->  01:38:33,168
Rene will be the evidence.

943
01:38:33,335 -->  01:38:37,047
If we can find him and stop him,
we will perhaps not only save his life...

944
01:38:37,214 -->  01:38:40,342
but prevent the collapse
of Western civilization.

945
01:38:41,176 -->  01:38:42,552
No pressure.

946
01:39:15,210 -->  01:39:17,212
Welcome, ambassador.

947
01:39:19,089 -->  01:39:21,383
Professor James Moriarty.

948
01:39:36,898 -->  01:39:38,191
Now we're all present...

949
01:39:38,358 -->  01:39:42,154
I can tell you that the targets are the
German chancellor and his ambassador...

950
01:39:42,320 -->  01:39:44,406
the French prime minister and his man.

951
01:39:44,573 -->  01:39:48,952
And the other nations are really working out
which side to take should hostilities erupt.

952
01:39:49,119 -->  01:39:52,372
Prince Michael, a cousin of the czar,
and the Russian ambassador.

953
01:39:52,539 -->  01:39:55,333
The Archduke Karl Ludwig
and the Austro-Hungarian ambassador.

954
01:39:55,917 -->  01:39:58,795
The Romanian Prime Minister
and his ambassador.

955
01:39:58,962 -->  01:40:02,382
And of course our prime minister
and the British ambassador.

956
01:40:02,549 -->  01:40:06,428
He'll choose a moment when the dignitaries
are assembled, preferably standing still.

957
01:40:06,595 -->  01:40:08,346
Is there to be an official photograph?

958
01:40:08,513 -->  01:40:12,392
Indeed, yes. In 38 minutes.

959
01:40:12,559 -->  01:40:15,520
In which case, we might as well dance.

960
01:40:20,859 -->  01:40:22,569
I've never done this before.

961
01:40:22,736 -->  01:40:27,574
Just follow my lead.

962
01:40:40,962 -->  01:40:43,006
- What do you see?
- Everything.

963
01:40:54,309 -->  01:40:56,353
That is my curse.

964
01:40:57,771 -->  01:41:00,732
But you don't see
what you're looking for.

965
01:41:18,083 -->  01:41:19,918
I thought you'd never ask.

966
01:41:22,671 -->  01:41:24,506
Over my shoulder.

967
01:41:24,673 -->  01:41:28,385
Young man, German uniform,
ceremonial sword.

968
01:41:28,760 -->  01:41:30,095
Got him.

969
01:41:30,804 -->  01:41:32,806
Professional opinion?

970
01:41:33,598 -->  01:41:35,517
Trauma.

971
01:41:35,684 -->  01:41:37,978
Major injury.

972
01:41:38,520 -->  01:41:40,647
But excellent repair work.

973
01:41:42,357 -->  01:41:43,775
Dr. Hoffmanstahl.

974
01:41:43,942 -->  01:41:47,279
<i>You did say he was
at the forefront of a medical innovation.</i>

975
01:41:47,445 -->  01:41:50,031
<i>We've already seen an example
of his skills.</i>

976
01:41:52,159 -->  01:41:54,411
Those twins weren't twins.

977
01:41:54,578 -->  01:41:56,997
My suspicions were aroused in Heilbronn...

978
01:41:57,914 -->  01:42:00,542
<i>when one failed to go to
the aid of the other.</i>

979
01:42:00,709 -->  01:42:04,921
I also noticed the discreet
but unmistakable puckering behind the ear...

980
01:42:05,088 -->  01:42:08,175
where his skin had been drawn back.
I should've realized then...

981
01:42:08,341 -->  01:42:11,219
that they were a surgical experiment.

982
01:42:11,553 -->  01:42:14,723
To see if it is possible
to make one man look like another.

983
01:42:15,098 -->  01:42:17,225
<i>His face is no longer his own.</i>

984
01:42:17,392 -->  01:42:21,396
What better way to guarantee his world war
than to make the assassin--

985
01:42:23,732 -->  01:42:24,900
One of the ambassadors.

986
01:42:27,194 -->  01:42:31,072
That narrows down the possibility
to one of six.

987
01:42:31,740 -->  01:42:34,743
You and Sim shall find her brother.

988
01:42:34,910 -->  01:42:37,078
- Of this I have no doubt.
- Holmes.

989
01:42:37,245 -->  01:42:39,331
You know my methods.

990
01:42:41,082 -->  01:42:43,084
And I know where you'll be.

991
01:42:43,668 -->  01:42:47,589
No possible solution could be
more congenial to me than this.

992
01:42:47,756 -->  01:42:51,092
By the way,
who taught you how to dance?

993
01:42:51,885 -->  01:42:53,220
You did.

994
01:42:53,386 -->  01:42:56,640
Well, I've done a fine job.

995
01:42:57,974 -->  01:42:59,768
Be careful.

996
01:43:37,764 -->  01:43:38,848
Shall we go to work?

997
01:43:41,059 -->  01:43:45,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, gather for the portrait.

998
01:43:54,114 -->  01:43:55,865
I'm sorry.

999
01:43:56,032 -->  01:43:58,285
Is this a bad time?

1000
01:43:58,910 -->  01:44:00,662
Never better.

1001
01:44:01,371 -->  01:44:02,874
Would you bring that clock?

1002
01:44:10,588 -->  01:44:13,425
We get to play that game after all.

1003
01:44:26,563 -->  01:44:28,356
Here we are.

1004
01:44:34,029 -->  01:44:36,239
Don't want you to catch a cold.

1005
01:44:41,036 -->  01:44:42,495
A five-minute game?

1006
01:44:43,538 -->  01:44:45,540
If you think you can manage it.

1007
01:45:06,519 -->  01:45:08,146
We both have two bishops.

1008
01:45:08,313 -->  01:45:11,107
I may be absent from the room,
but my methods are not.

1009
01:45:11,566 -->  01:45:13,443
You can't mean Dr. Watson, surely.

1010
01:45:15,528 -->  01:45:16,863
That doesn't seem fair.

1011
01:45:22,952 -->  01:45:26,456
Right. The surgery will have left scars.

1012
01:45:26,956 -->  01:45:29,584
Only four of them have the hairline
to hide them.

1013
01:45:33,922 -->  01:45:37,217
The ambassador that you replaced with Rene,
is he still alive?

1014
01:45:40,887 -->  01:45:43,139
Would you like me to recommend
your next move?

1015
01:45:43,306 -->  01:45:47,018
They're all my brother's height,
right build...

1016
01:45:47,185 -->  01:45:48,978
but their eyes.

1017
01:45:49,145 -->  01:45:51,815
Their eyes are wrong.
Rene has blue eyes.

1018
01:45:54,359 -->  01:45:57,112
He could be wearing glass lenses
to change the color.

1019
01:45:58,446 -->  01:46:01,116
In which case, his eyes will be hurting.

1020
01:46:02,826 -->  01:46:05,286
Rene is left-handed.

1021
01:46:05,453 -->  01:46:07,455
<i>Perhaps the assassin will take measures...</i>

1022
01:46:07,622 -->  01:46:09,749
<i>to ensure he doesn't give himself away.</i>

1023
01:46:09,916 -->  01:46:11,459
Like a gambler concealing a tell.

1024
01:46:17,132 -->  01:46:19,884
I think it might be him.

1025
01:46:21,302 -->  01:46:22,303
You think?

1026
01:46:22,470 -->  01:46:24,097
Your clock is ticking.

1027
01:46:24,264 -->  01:46:25,306
You have to be sure.

1028
01:46:25,473 -->  01:46:28,268
<i>May I remind you,
this is blitz chess.</i>

1029
01:46:28,435 -->  01:46:31,271
<i>A single miscalculation
will cost you the game.</i>

1030
01:46:33,398 -->  01:46:36,901
If I tackle the wrong man to the ground,
I could start a war.

1031
01:46:37,902 -->  01:46:39,529
<i>Maybe it's less obvious.</i>

1032
01:46:39,696 -->  01:46:42,949
<i>A nervous tic.
A flutter of anxiety.</i>

1033
01:46:43,116 -->  01:46:45,994
I expect everyone has a reason
to be nervous tonight.

1034
01:46:51,624 -->  01:46:53,042
I don't know.

1035
01:47:00,300 -->  01:47:02,218
<i>So perhaps it's the opposite:</i>

1036
01:47:02,385 -->  01:47:04,554
<i>A failure to behave naturally.</i>

1037
01:47:05,722 -->  01:47:08,016
<i>An actor so consumed
with his performance...</i>

1038
01:47:08,183 -->  01:47:11,269
<i>that the one characteristic
he cannot accommodate...</i>

1039
01:47:11,436 -->  01:47:13,062
is spontaneous reaction.

1040
01:48:04,364 -->  01:48:06,658
Carruthers, protect the prime minister.

1041
01:48:15,291 -->  01:48:18,253
Germany will pay!
Mark my words!

1042
01:48:19,087 -->  01:48:20,755
That doesn't bode well, does it?

1043
01:48:22,757 -->  01:48:27,220
Seems your bishop
was of some benefit after all.

1044
01:48:27,720 -->  01:48:28,805
The game is still young.

1045
01:48:28,972 -->  01:48:31,015
Actually, it's in its adolescence.

1046
01:48:35,853 -->  01:48:37,146
There are more of us!

1047
01:48:39,482 -->  01:48:42,235
Germany will pay!

1048
01:48:50,451 -->  01:48:52,870
No loose ends.

1049
01:48:58,084 -->  01:49:01,379
What happened to him?
I'm a doctor. A doctor!

1050
01:49:22,567 -->  01:49:24,485
What happened?

1051
01:49:24,652 -->  01:49:26,279
- Curare.
- What's wrong with him?

1052
01:49:26,446 -->  01:49:27,655
It's poison.

1053
01:49:27,822 -->  01:49:29,490
Do something!

1054
01:49:34,162 -->  01:49:35,413
Doctor, do something!

1055
01:49:36,497 -->  01:49:37,832
No.

1056
01:49:53,514 -->  01:49:57,727
I think you've just lost
your most valuable piece.

1057
01:49:58,478 -->  01:50:02,523
But a winning strategy
sometimes necessitates sacrifice.

1058
01:50:02,690 -->  01:50:04,150
A war has been averted.

1059
01:50:04,317 -->  01:50:06,736
Mm. Oh, I disagree.

1060
01:50:07,320 -->  01:50:08,363
How so?

1061
01:50:09,197 -->  01:50:12,659
Didn't you find it strange
that the telegram you sent...

1062
01:50:12,825 -->  01:50:15,536
didn't inspire any action to stop me?

1063
01:50:18,623 -->  01:50:22,960
You see, hidden within the unconscious...

1064
01:50:23,127 -->  01:50:25,713
is an insatiable desire for conflict.

1065
01:50:28,299 -->  01:50:34,347
So you're not fighting me so much
as you are the human condition.

1066
01:50:35,556 -->  01:50:39,769
All I want to do is own the bullets
and the bandages.

1067
01:50:41,396 -->  01:50:45,149
War on an industrial scale is inevitable.

1068
01:50:45,316 -->  01:50:48,736
They'll do it themselves
within a few years.

1069
01:50:49,862 -->  01:50:53,700
All I have to do is wait.

1070
01:50:58,413 -->  01:51:00,915
I like Switzerland.

1071
01:51:01,082 -->  01:51:04,085
They respect a man's privacy here.

1072
01:51:04,502 -->  01:51:07,255
Particularly if he has a fortune.

1073
01:51:15,179 -->  01:51:16,806
Bishop takes knight. Check.

1074
01:51:17,432 -->  01:51:19,434
The game is over.

1075
01:51:20,143 -->  01:51:22,311
You should get that shoulder looked at.

1076
01:51:22,478 -->  01:51:24,814
About that fortune of yours.

1077
01:51:24,981 -->  01:51:30,111
I believe it's just
been substantially reduced.

1078
01:51:30,737 -->  01:51:31,904
King to rook two.

1079
01:51:32,071 -->  01:51:33,948
I attended several of your lectures.

1080
01:51:34,115 -->  01:51:36,868
The equations of motion,
which you will find in my book.

1081
01:51:37,034 -->  01:51:40,037
The energy that is required
to release these explosions is--

1082
01:51:40,204 -->  01:51:44,000
<i>It was in Oslo when I first caught
a glimpse of your little notebook...</i>

1083
01:51:44,167 -->  01:51:46,544
red leather-bound from
Smythson of Bond Street.

1084
01:51:46,711 -->  01:51:50,214
Rook to king's rook three. Check.

1085
01:51:59,182 -->  01:52:00,475
Bishop to rook three.

1086
01:52:00,641 -->  01:52:03,186
Its importance was not
fully apparent to me...

1087
01:52:03,352 -->  01:52:06,314
<i>until I observed your penchant
for feeding pigeons.</i>

1088
01:52:06,481 -->  01:52:10,401
Then it occurred
that with an empire so enormous...

1089
01:52:10,568 -->  01:52:13,821
even you must keep a record
of it somewhere.

1090
01:52:13,988 -->  01:52:15,364
Bishop takes bishop.

1091
01:52:16,240 -->  01:52:17,617
Rook to bishop four.

1092
01:52:17,784 -->  01:52:20,620
I then only required the notebook itself.

1093
01:52:21,120 -->  01:52:22,205
<i>You didn't make it easy.</i>

1094
01:52:24,207 -->  01:52:25,541
Just the bags.

1095
01:52:25,708 -->  01:52:28,169
I would need to endure
a considerable amount of pain.

1096
01:52:30,505 -->  01:52:31,589
Mycroft...

1097
01:52:32,590 -->  01:52:36,385
care of Her Majesty's Secret Service.

1098
01:52:36,552 -->  01:52:40,681
But the notebook would undoubtedly be encoded,
so how then to break the code?

1099
01:52:41,766 -->  01:52:44,143
- Rook takes rook.
- Pawn takes rook.

1100
01:52:44,310 -->  01:52:46,103
Bishop to bishop seven.

1101
01:52:46,270 -->  01:52:48,231
Queen takes knight pawn.

1102
01:52:48,397 -->  01:52:53,778
Does <i>The Art of Domestic Horticulture</i>
mean anything to you?

1103
01:52:54,862 -->  01:52:57,406
<i>How could a man as meticulous as you
own such a book...</i>

1104
01:52:57,573 -->  01:53:01,661
yet completely neglect the flowers
in his own window box? Irony abounds.

1105
01:53:07,583 -->  01:53:09,794
Never mind, it's safe, in London...

1106
01:53:11,504 -->  01:53:14,090
<i>where my colleagues are making
good use of it.</i>

1107
01:53:15,341 -->  01:53:19,220
<i>The most formidable criminal mind in Europe
has just had all his money stolen...</i>

1108
01:53:19,387 -->  01:53:23,933
by perhaps the most inept inspector
in the history of Scotland Yard.

1109
01:53:24,100 -->  01:53:25,518
Any chance of a cup of tea?

1110
01:53:25,685 -->  01:53:28,354
Box 0403.

1111
01:53:28,771 -->  01:53:31,399
- Tick.
- Box 0801.

1112
01:53:31,566 -->  01:53:33,192
How much more is there?

1113
01:53:33,555 -->  01:53:35,724
That's the end of page two.

1114
01:53:35,890 -->  01:53:37,058
Page three.

1115
01:53:47,402 -->  01:53:52,574
He'll be making an anonymous donation
to the Widows and Orphans of War Fund.

1116
01:53:52,741 -->  01:53:56,119
Bishop to bishop eight.
Discover check.

1117
01:53:56,286 -->  01:53:58,913
And, incidentally, mate.

1118
01:54:03,501 -->  01:54:05,879
I seem to have injured my shoulder.
Would you mind?

1119
01:54:11,384 -->  01:54:13,345
Be my pleasure.

1120
01:54:16,264 -->  01:54:20,143
Once we've concluded our business here...

1121
01:54:20,310 -->  01:54:22,812
it's important you know...

1122
01:54:22,979 -->  01:54:27,192
I shall endeavor to find
the most creative of endings for the doctor.

1123
01:54:30,695 -->  01:54:31,863
And his wife.

1124
01:54:36,701 -->  01:54:38,578
<i>His advantage, my injury.</i>

1125
01:54:38,745 -->  01:54:41,748
<i>My advantage, his rage.</i>

1126
01:54:43,625 -->  01:54:48,004
<i>Incoming assault feral,
but experienced.</i>

1127
01:54:48,254 -->  01:54:51,091
<i>Use his momentum to counter.</i>

1128
01:54:56,721 -->  01:54:58,431
<i>Come now.</i>

1129
01:54:58,932 -->  01:55:03,228
<i>You really think you're the only one
who can play this game.</i>

1130
01:55:03,395 -->  01:55:06,940
<i>Trap arm. Target weakness.</i>

1131
01:55:07,399 -->  01:55:09,234
<i>Follow with haymaker.</i>

1132
01:55:09,401 -->  01:55:12,362
<i>Ah. There we find
the boxing champion of Cambridge.</i>

1133
01:55:12,529 -->  01:55:14,906
<i>Competent, but predictable.</i>

1134
01:55:17,242 -->  01:55:20,120
<i>Now allow me to reply.</i>

1135
01:55:21,621 -->  01:55:24,958
<i>Arsenal running dry.
Adjust strategy.</i>

1136
01:55:29,087 -->  01:55:31,256
<i>Wound taking its toll.</i>

1137
01:55:31,423 -->  01:55:35,885
<i>As I feared.
Injury makes defense untenable.</i>

1138
01:55:40,974 -->  01:55:44,978
<i>Prognosis increasingly negative.</i>

1139
01:55:48,940 -->  01:55:52,485
<i>Let's not waste any more
of one another's time.</i>

1140
01:55:57,365 -->  01:56:00,285
<i>We both know how this ends.</i>

1141
01:56:14,257 -->  01:56:16,468
<i>Conclusion, inevitable.</i>

1142
01:56:19,220 -->  01:56:20,263
<i>Unless...</i>

1143
01:57:29,332 -->  01:57:33,545
<i>A few words may suffice
to tell the little that remains.</i>

1144
01:57:40,718 -->  01:57:46,057
<i>Any attempt at finding the bodies
was absolutely hopeless.</i>

1145
01:57:50,228 -->  01:57:52,355
<i>And so there...</i>

1146
01:57:52,522 -->  01:57:58,444
<i>deep down in that dreadful caldron
of swirling water and seething foam...</i>

1147
01:58:03,908 -->  01:58:05,159
<i>will lie for all time...</i>

1148
01:58:08,288 -->  01:58:10,748
<i>the most dangerous criminal...</i>

1149
01:58:12,750 -->  01:58:17,088
<i>and the foremost champion of the law
of their generation.</i>

1150
01:58:22,218 -->  01:58:25,471
<i>I shall ever regard him as the best...</i>

1151
01:58:30,393 -->  01:58:34,439
<i>and the wisest man
whom I have ever known.</i>

1152
01:58:34,605 -->  01:58:36,274
John?

1153
01:58:38,818 -->  01:58:40,987
- John.
- Mm-hm.

1154
01:58:41,654 -->  01:58:43,281
You should probably pack.

1155
01:58:43,448 -->  01:58:44,490
It's half past 2...

1156
01:58:44,657 -->  01:58:46,576
- and the carriage is coming at 4.
- Mm.

1157
01:58:47,910 -->  01:58:50,330
It's gonna be a beautiful week in Brighton.

1158
01:58:51,164 -->  01:58:52,999
Yes, it'll be fun.

1159
01:58:53,541 -->  01:58:54,959
I'm looking forward to it.

1160
01:58:57,128 -->  01:58:58,921
You know I miss him too...

1161
01:58:59,630 -->  01:59:01,299
in my own way.

1162
01:59:08,473 -->  01:59:09,932
He would have wanted us to go.

1163
01:59:11,601 -->  01:59:14,437
He would have wanted to come with us.

1164
01:59:15,938 -->  01:59:18,274
When's Mrs. Hudson coming for Gladstone?

1165
01:59:18,441 -->  01:59:20,651
Oh, soon.

1166
01:59:22,737 -->  01:59:24,364
Three o'clock.

1167
01:59:50,598 -->  01:59:52,058
Mary?

1168
01:59:53,684 -->  01:59:55,770
Who delivered this parcel?

1169
01:59:55,937 -->  01:59:57,897
The postman.

1170
01:59:59,315 -->  02:00:01,609
The usual chap or--

1171
02:00:01,776 -->  02:00:04,821
did he look peculiar?

1172
02:08:41,921 -->  02:08:43,923
